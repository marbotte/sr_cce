## 1.1 abstract

This quasi-experimental study explored the impact of inquiry-based
instruction on students’ conceptions of climate change and their
perceptions of science learning environment. A total of 68 senior
primary school students participated into the study. Data sources
included Questionnaire on Global Climate Change and Constructivist
Learning Environment Survey. Data were coded and analysed using
quantitative procedures. Before the instruction, about 25% of the
participants were aware of the major consequences of, causes of and
possible cures for climate change. Following the instruction, about
50–85% of the participants developed scientific understandings about
climate change, but the participants showed slow progress in terms of
identifying nonscientific conceptions concerning climate change. In
addition, students perceived inquiry-based learning environment more
encouraging compared to their regular science classes. © 2020 ASPE.

RQ1, Consequences of climate change : Following the instruction, about
75–85% of the participants developed scientific ideas about the major
consequences of climate change, and they were able to connect the idea
of desertification with the climate change (see Table 1). However, the
progression in connecting the ideas of flooding and having more bugs and
pests on crops with climate change was not as dramatic as the other
scientific ideas. RQ1, causes of climate change: Following the
instruction, more than 50% of the participants developed scientific
understandings about the major causes of climate change, and in total,
about 75–80% of the participants were sure that the climate change is
caused by the large amount of carbon dioxide released into the
atmosphere. RQ1 cures of climate change: Following the instruction,
70–80% of the participants developed the idea about the frequently
recognised cures for climate change such as planting trees, recycling
paper and rarely using cars for transportation. RQ2 Students
understanding of climate change: A paired samples t-test of the
participants’ pre and postquestionnaire total scores indicated a
statistically significant change toward a scientific understanding of
global climate change (t = −13.779,p \< .01) (see Table 4) The
participant answered also better to questions which were not from the
lessons or related to school programs the authors give this
interpretation: The participants, who provided scientific responses on
the questionnaire, may have either been guessed or learned from other
sources based their individual efforts.

## 2.1 abstract

The rapid digitalization following COVID-19 necessitates best-practice
knowledge on how to use educational technologies such as immersive
virtual reality (IVR). At the same time, to deal with climate change, we
require new ways to embed climate change education in formal education.
The current study is one of the first to investigate the feasibility of
an alternative educational approach to improving waste management in the
classroom as part of formal education, utilizing mastery experiences in
IVR. We explore the use of a novel IVR simulation on waste management,
an example of pro-environmental behavior, for climate change education.
A total of 173 high school students participated in a pre-registered
intervention investigating the impact of IVR on knowledge and intentions
to act pro-environmentally. A 2x2 design was used to compare different
design approaches to the IVR simulation based on the instructional
design elements of the instruction sequence (Direct Instruction
vs. Productive Failure) and feedback (Corrective Feedback
vs. Exaggerated Feedback). The results indicated that IVR was effective
for increasing students’ knowledge (η2 = 0.41), intentions (η2 = 0.10),
self-efficacy (η2 = 0.4), and response efficacy (η2 = 0.35) and that
students found the simulation interesting and enjoyable. Furthermore,
self-efficacy was found to predict intentions (B = 0.190, p = .015),
supporting the idea that cognitive and affective factors drive the
effectiveness of IVR. No significant differences were found in the
effectiveness of the instructional design elements. This suggests that
IVR can be an effective educational technology for learning through
mastery experiences, but that more research on the boundary conditions
of how and when to apply different instructional design elements
effectively is needed. © 2023 The Authors

## 3.1 abstract

Although learning can occur in many environments e. g. science museum or
zoo, some studies reported that teachers are prone to avoid outdoor
activities since they lack of field trip training. For that reason; this
study aims to explore the effect of the exhibition on preservice science
teachers’ views about global climate change (GCC) as well as teaching
drawing technique. The visiting of American National History Museum’s
“Climate Change: The Threat to Life and A New Energy Future” exhibition
allows to see how individual, communal, and governmental actions in
using energy more efficiently, in combination with pursuing promising
new energy alternatives, can make a meaningful impact in reducing GCC.
Data analysis revealed that they have learned drawing technique which is
an effective way to obtain students’ perceptions. Additionally, the
effect of exhibition on preservice teachers’ awareness and knowledge of
GCC showed clearly changing and teachers’ self-confidence have been
increased to use outdoor activities. Moreover, with this field trip
experience let them to transfer their understanding about informal
learning into classroom practice.

## 4.1 abstract

The United Nations’ declaration on climate change education in December
2014 has sparked a renewal of policies and programs initiated during the
‘Decade of Education for Sustainable Development’ (DESD, 2005-2014),
aimed at promoting awareness, understanding, and civic action for
environmental sustainability within learning communities all around the
world. We present findings from a dialogic, multimodal, and
literacies-based educational project designed to provide secondary
students (N = 141) from four countries with the resources to read about
and discuss evidence regarding climate change from seminal studies with
peers and a core group of scientists (N = 7). Post-program interviews
revealed a significant increase in language use related to
evidence-based reasoning. Students also demonstrated an increased
propensity to recycle. These findings support the hypothesis that
providing opportunities for students to read and discuss seminal
scientific sources incites positive changes in beliefs, attitudes, and
behaviors related to climate change and climate science, and
understandings of the nature of scientific evidence and argumentation.

continual process of evidence-based reasoning and consensus-building
(e.g. scientists test their ideas again and again; they have a question
and figure out a way to get an answer so that other scientists can see
what they did and judge for themselves if it is correct) and move away

## 5.1 abstract

We report the results of a climate change module delivered to 48 Grade
3/4 students in Nova Scotia, Canada. We tested for prior knowledge and
evaluated interventional effectiveness using art elicitation. Common
climate change misconceptions were demonstrated in their preintervention
artwork, while postintervention artwork showed improved concordance with
climate change causes and impacts, with little grasp of adaptation or
mitigation. Students and teachers alike responded positively to the
lessons, and few students demonstrated negative emotional reactions to
the material. We highlight some shortcomings, but demonstrate the
utility of art elicitation and the appropriateness of introducing
climate change to Grade 4 students. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis

## 6.1 abstract

Effective strategies to learn about and engage with climate change play
an important role in addressing this challenge. There is a growing
recognition that education needs to change in order to address climate
change, yet the question remains “how?” How does one engage young people
with a topic that is perceived as abstract, distant, and complex, and
which at the same time is contributing to growing feelings of sadness,
hopelessness, and anxiety among them? In this paper, I argue that
although the important contributions that the arts and humanities can
make to this challenge are widely discussed, they remain an untapped or
underutilized potential. I then present a novel framework and
demonstrate its use in schools. Findings from a high school in Portugal
point to the central place that art can play in climate change education
and engagement more general, with avenues for greater depth of learning
and transformative potential. The paper provides guidance for
involvementin,with, andthroughart and makes suggestions to create links
between disciplines to support meaning-making, create new images, and
metaphors and bring in a wider solution space for climate change. Going
beyond the stereotypes of art as communication and mainstream climate
change education, it offers teachers, facilitators, and researchers a
wider portfolio for climate change engagement that makes use of the
multiple potentials of the arts.

## 7.1 abstract

In this mixed method study, we analyse the effectiveness of two
pedagogical approaches - one model-based and another non-model-based -
for developing secondary students’ understanding of the phenomenon of
increase in Earth’s average surface temperatures, a core dimension of
global climate change (GCC). Building on past research on teaching and
learning about Earth’s climate, we use an Evidence-Based Reasoning
framework to assess student tasks and interviews from a 3-week,
project-developed, model-based curriculum. We observed that the use of a
climate model allowed students to reason more effectively about the
Earth’s increasing temperatures. They were able to establish the premise
and interpret evidence for the phenomenon more effectively with the
climate model. Using temperature and carbon dioxide data sets, students
observed and quantified the behaviour of climate variables, establishing
correlation and causation through data-integrated claims. In doing so,
students were able to develop scientific knowledge about climate science
as well as understand the processes undertaken by climate scientists in
analysing climate data. Given the importance of fostering climate
literacy in K-12 students, study findings have implications for both
teaching and learning about GCC using climate models, as well as in
shifting students’ focus from acquiring knowledge to constructing their
own knowledge.

## 8.1 abstract

We examined students’ understanding of the causes of a scientific
phenomenon from a multiple-document-inquiry unit. Students read several
documents that each described causal factors that could be integrated to
address the given writing task of explaining the causes of change in
average global temperature. We manipulated whether the document set
included a document that took a position on climate change policies and
whether a reading/writing prompt focused only on understanding the
causes (“explain how and why recent temperature changes are occurring”)
or also included a solution-related addendum (“and what we can do about
it”). The results suggest that including a policy-related document can
lead to poorer learning outcomes for the causes of climate change, with
evidence that students focused on policy in lieu of, rather than in
relation to, a causal understanding of the issue.

"In this study the main goal of the inquiry task for all students was to
provide an explanation for how and why global temperatures are changing
from a document set that contained several documents, each of which
described different aspects of the phenomenon (e.g., Griffin et al.,
2012; Wiley et al., 2009). Although all students were given the same
core document set, some students also received an additional document
relating to policy changes that could be made to combat climate change.
If the additional policy document is distracting to students or if the
presence of this document changes their task model to that of writing an
opinion essay, then they should focus on this policy information at the
expense of causal information. Therefore, students with this document
should include less causal information in their essays and perform worse
on the inference verification task than those with only the core
document set." "Given the call for students to read more authentic
science material and the belief that considering solutions or involving
students in policy-related discussions can better engage students’
interest, it is important to demonstrate whether these activities lead
to benefits in understanding."

## 9.1 abstract

Climate change science is a challenging topic for student learning. This
quantitative study examined the effectiveness of a geospatial curriculum
approach to promote climate change science understandings in an urban
school district with eighth-grade students and investigated whether
teacher- and student-level factors accounted for students’ climate
change knowledge achievement. The participants included 12 science
teachers and 956 eighth-grade students. Data included a pre- and
posttest climate change assessment measures for both teachers and
students and a teacher measure of Geospatial Science-Technological
Pedagogical Content Knowledge. Paired-sample t tests revealed
statistically significant gains from pretest to posttest on their
climate change knowledge (p \< .001; effect sizes being large on
multiple-choice items and medium on the open-ended response assessment).
Both ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression and 2-level
hierarchical linear modeling found that students’ initial climate change
knowledge and gender were significant predictors for students’ posttest
scores, p \< .05. Students’ pretest scores were the strongest
significant predictor of the posttest scores, p \< .001. Neither the
teachers’ climate change knowledge nor their Geospatial
Science-Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge had significant
association with the students’ posttest scores. Teaching years was a
significant predictor for students’ posttest scores in OLS regression (p
\< .001). The findings provide support that a geospatial curriculum
approach is an effective science curriculum approach for learners in
urban middle-level education.

## 10.1 abstract

Both scientists and policy-makers emphasize the importance of education
for influencing pro-environmental behavior and minimizing the effects of
climate change on biological and physical systems. Education has the
potential to impact students’ system knowledge - their understanding of
the variables that affect the climate system - and action knowledge -
their understanding of behaviors that can impact the system. Research on
climate change education has largely focused on system and action
knowledge that address mitigation while overlooking equally necessary
adaptive responses. This study used a pre/post-test format to identify
aspects of middle and high school students’ climate system knowledge and
action knowledge of both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.
Results indicate that adolescents currently conflate climate change
mitigation strategies with unrelated environmental problems far less
than in previous surveys. However, students demonstrated limited
understanding of adaptive responses to climate change. After engaging in
an instructional unit on climate change, students expressed stronger
system and action knowledge, but significant misconceptions remained
that conflated mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.

## 11.1 abstract

Findings from the second phase of a study of pre-service teachers’
attitudes to environmental education and knowledge of climate change are
reported in this paper. A sample of 87 pre-service teachers participated
in a survey study in the last year of their Bachelor of Education degree
to examine developments to their attitudes to environmental education
and their knowledge of climate change as a result of training. Results
showed their attitudes towards environmental education were consistently
favourable, but their climate change science knowledge had not changed
as a result of their participation in their degree. Data on preservice
teachers’ sources of knowledge for climate change, their views on
important substantive climate change knowledge for their future students
and their perceptions of gaps in their own training in relation to
climate change were also investigated in order to triangulate the survey
data. Implications for preservice teacher education are discussed.

## 12.1 abstract

This study aimed to identify the erroneous knowledge and misconceptions
of preservice elementary teachers about global warming and examine the
effects of instruction with visual materials on rectifying these
misconceptions and fostering a positive attitude towards the issue of
global warming. Having a quasi-experimental design, the study made use
of both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The participants
of the study, which was conducted in 2008-2009 academic year in Giresun
University’s Education Faculty, were 47 preservice elementary teachers.
Data were obtained by using open ended questions, the Global Warming
Attitude Scale (GWAS) and semi-structured interview forms. The results
showed that both experimental and control group individuals had
knowledge gaps and certain misconceptions about the reasons underlying
global warming. However, preservice teachers were more successful in
rectifying the gaps and misconceptions via instruction with visual
materials. After the intervention, the experimental group had higher
global warming attitude scores. However, no meaningful relationship
existed between the groups with respect to their attitude scores.

## 13.1 abstract

There is a need to approach environmental education (EE) topics, such as
climate change, with a framework that productively reflects its inherent
complexity. This study investigates how computational thinking (CT),
specifically systems thinking (ST), may prepare educators to teach
climate change. As scientists increasingly rely on computational
techniques in their studies of complex EE topics, it is incumbent on
science education to provide learners with computational thinking
opportunities. We investigated how elementary preservice teachers (PSTs)
in a science methods course (N=35) adapted a curricular resource on the
climate change topic of sea level rise to integrate the CT practice of
ST. Changes in their thinking were analyzed. Findings suggest that PSTs
prior to instruction held a limited understanding of climate systems,
often conflating weather and climate. Post instruction, their thinking
expanded to consider the relationships between carbon dioxide, global
warming, ice melt, and sea level rise. Further, many were able to
describe these systems in a future EE teaching activity for young
learners. A major implication was the need to develop a continuum of CT
practices for elementary educators, with an emphasis on ST, for complex
environmental education topics, that could frame their pedagogical
thinking for climate change education. © 2019 by the authors.

Before and after session 1, preservice teachers were asked to respond
online to the prompt: "List up to three science related questions you
have about climate systems and climate change. This might involve the
interrelationships between factors, how different factors affect each
other, or connections between humans and climate change." Data were
collected and coded for the number and type of systems in their pre and
post responses. independent interrater agreement was approximately 90%,
with subsequent negotiation among the three raters resulting in over 95%
agreement. After session 2, they responded to the following prompt:
"Within the context of climate change, what systems/systems models do
you now know inform a scientific understanding of sea level rise, and
how would you use such models to teach upper elementary students how
scientists think about the causes of sea level rise with an emphasis on
systems thinking?" Using the instrument developed earlier, responses
were coded and codes tabulated. While data were not collected prior to
instruction for this prompt, the use of the same codes allowed for
comparison with their responses in the previous section The researchers
realized later that the preservice teachers did not mention fossil fuels
in their responses in session 1 and 2. Data were collected from four
PSTs using selected questions from the CSKAI (Drewes, et al., 2017) to
gain a sense of PSTs’ understanding of the role of fossil fuels in

Pre-post session 1: - The primary change in PSTs’ questions before and
after instruction was a shift from an emphasis on the relationship
between weather and climate change towards the greenhouse effect and the
role of greenhouse gases. - PSTs shifted towards a more mechanistic view
of climate change, involving CO2 and the greenhouse effect, their view
was still constrained and might not include key relationships between
the systems involved in climate change. Post-session 2 (Sea level
rise) - their understanding developed further to include global warming,
ice melt, and sea level rise. - weather was no longer present in their
responses, suggesting they no longer considered it a primary component
of climate change. - Still absent from their responses was the
relationship between fossil fuels and other drivers of climate change.
Additional questionnaire on fossil fuels: - The PSTs’ responses to the
selected CSKAI questions indicated they understand the connection
between the use of fossil fuels, CO2, and global warming

## 14.1 abstract

A two-day workshop was designed in order to increase awareness of
pre-service teachers about the role of forests in adapting and
mitigating the effects of climate change. In this workshop, five
different activities were developed to reflect five sections, which are
listed as forest strengths and weakness, general knowledge on climate
change, the role of forests in climate change, forest policies and
climate change and climate refugees, were implemented as part of project
“Educating on Climate Forests.” The designed activities focused on
increasing participants’ awareness about general knowledge on climate
change, the adaptation and mitigation strategies in order to adapt
living with climate change, the climate refugee situation, the
importance of forest management and environmental conservation
strategies and the destructive effects of deforestation. The present
study investigated pre-service teachers’ opinions about the designed
activities. Through the designed activities, participants had an
opportunity to develop deeper insights into the role of forests in
adapting and mitigating the effects of climate change. After each
activity, participants’ opinions were gathered via written reflection
forms. In general, the results revealed that participants thought the
implemented activities were increased their awareness. Although they
stated that they had time and material insufficiency, they proposed
suggestions for improving the activities.

## 15.1 abstract

Background It is now essential for students to learn in the science
classroom about climate change and the part they can play in
ameliorating its consequences. This requires science teachers to have a
secure understanding of climate change. Purpose The aim of this study is
to investigate the effectiveness of a two-day outdoor educational
workshop on preservice teachers’ awareness of climate change and the
role of forests in mitigating the effects of climate change.
Participants 20 pre-service teachers voluntarily participated in the
workshop. Design and method A one-group pre-and post-test design was
used to investigate the changes in preservice teachers’ cognitive
structures after attending the workshop. Data were collected using a
word association test (pre and post) and participants’ reflection forms
(post). The cut-off technique was used in analysing the word association
test and thematic analysis was used in analysing participants’
reflection forms. Results The results indicated that the workshop
stimulated preservice teachers’ cognitive structures and conceptual
understandings of climate change. Moreover, they generally had positive
opinions about the workshop activities, emphasizing that these increased
their awareness and empathy skills. However, they also indicated a small
range of negative factors including a lack of time, materials, and
opportunity to debate, and being tired. Conclusions Non-formal outdoor
learning programmes can promote learning and increase preservice
teachers’ awareness with respect to climate change.

This article discusses the implementation of a pedagogical tool aimed at
the refutation of secondary school (grade ten-equivalent) students’
persistent climate change misconceptions. Using a lesson study approach,
the materials and intervention techniques used were developed
collaboratively with geography teachers. The objective is two-pronged:
to closely monitor how children learn through refutation-oriented
approach and to document how teachers process the experience. A pretest
and post-test comparison showed that there was significant improvement
in the students’ climate change conceptual understanding following the
intervention.

research instruments included five- lesson plans using the Four Noble
Truths method with three metacognitive techniques: intelligibility,
plausibility and wide-applicability (each plan consists of three hours
learning per week); a knowledge test on global warming; questionnaire on
global warming awareness; questionnaire on global warming decreasing
behavior; and a critical thinking test. The major findings revealed that
the experimental group and based on prior Biology learning outcome had
more knowledge, awareness, global warming decreasing behavior, and
critical thinking prior to learning. The high Biology achievers had
higher awareness of global warming in two areas, global warming
decreasing behavior in one area and critical thinking than the lower
Biology achievers in three areas. The experimental group had more
knowledge, awareness of global warming generally and in one area, global
warming decreasing behavior generally and in one area and overall
critical thinking in three aspects than the control group students. In
addition, there were statistical correlations between prior Biology
learning outcome with learning model and global warming awareness,
global warming decreasing behavior, and critical thinking.

## 18.1 abstract

This study explored the effects of arguing to learn in a socioscientific
context on the fundamental and derived components of reading, writing,
and science understanding as integral parts of science literacy. We
adopted mixed-methods in which the 1-group pretest-posttest design with
supplemental interviews and questionnaires. The pretest evaluated the
dependent variables (reading and writing scores), the treatment was
arguing to learn about the global climate change issue, the posttest
evaluated the dependent variables, and follow-up questionnaires and
interviews informed the quantitative results. An intact grade six class
(N = 28) at an urban elementary school located in central Taiwan was the
participants. Analyses of the pretest-posttest gain scores and
correlations between these outcomes revealed significant (p \< 0.05)
improvements in writing and associations among reading, writing, and
arguing to learn. Interpretation of the qualitative data (interview and
questionnaire responses) supported that argumentation as an
instructional treatment focused on fundamental literacy could play a
positive role in facilitating students’ enhanced science understanding
(derived literacy).

This 7-week study included three phases: reading–writing
activity/pretest, arguing to learn/treatment, and reading–writing
activity/posttest. Week 2 and the remaining class time in weeks 1, 3,
and 4 were focused on the textbook and teaching the Weather unit. 1.
Phase 1 focused on fundamental literacy practices and science
understanding that involved directed activities related to texts (DARTs;
Wellington & Osborne, 2001) and to complete a global climate change
reading–writing worksheet. DARTs utilized the
constructive–interpretative language arts pair of reading–writing and
integrated the literacy practices of learning to read and write. 2.
Phase 2, the instruction phase (90 min in week 3), used arguing to learn
about socioscientific issues and focused on learning and using
fundamental literacy practices. After the warm-ups, the students were
arranged to individually finish the arguing-to-learn worksheet 2 days
later within 30 min during the single class period. The teacher
encouraged students to actively use the learned skills, but he did not
provide any answers related to Fig. 2; this process focused on students
using the argumentation task (a fundamental literacy practice) they had
learned and the literacy practices about the global climate change
issue. 3. Phase 3 repeated the phase 1 reading–writing activity and
posttest (90 min distributed in three class periods in week 4) using the
same textual materials.

## 19.1 abstract

This study aims to investigate climate literacy among junior high school
students participating in an SSI-STEAM climate change education program
and to examine the impacts of the program on the cultivation of climate
literacy. Thirty- one eighth-grade students in Seoul, Korea,
participated in this study. Data were collected using pre- and
post-program surveys with a climate literacy questionnaire (CLQ),
students’ background survey questions, interviews with participants, and
from the artifacts produced by students during the program.
Participants’ climate literacy was shown to improve substantially after
attending the program, especially in the domains of perception and
action. The four characteristics of climate literacy change were
identified in the participants’ responses: more concrete ideas,
extension of the scope of thinking, positive responsibility, and
relevance recognition. The climate literacy program developed showed
potential for fostering young people’s climate literacy along with their
understanding of responsible national and global citizenship. The study
discusses the implications of these findings and includes suggestions
for future climate literacy program development and for both curricular
and extra-curricular climate change education that can together nurture
students’ more profound understanding of climate change.

## 20.1 abstract

The purpose of this paper is to integrate mathematical modeling and
ecology by presenting an activity involving an authentic environmental
problem, which is called “Pine Processionary Caterpillars Invasion.”
Adopting Mathematical Modeling and Education for Climate Action (EfCA)
approaches, it was aimed to encourage pre-service teachers (PSTs) to use
the power of mathematical modeling processes to make inferences from
data and evidence and make informed decisions by producing action plans
to solve an ecological problem caused by climate change. The study was
conducted with eight pre-service mathematics teachers and eight
pre-service science teachers in a public university in Turkey. All PSTs
worked as groups so that their mastery and thinking styles enriched each
other. At the end of the activity, we noticed that some of the
pre-service teachers confronted difficulties such as coming up with a
working mathematical model, collecting real-world data from the pine
forests, and efficiently computing steps of mathematical modeling
without any errors. However, pre-service teachers could make use of the
views of their working partners having different disciplines and
appreciated the usefulness of mathematical modeling to solve an
ecological problem. They also realized the interconnectedness of species
and developed empathy for the welfare of society and nature.

provided implicitly, rather than explicitly so that PSTs needed further
calculations specific to their purpose. After they introduced the
problem, the PSTs started making nature observations, collecting
real-world data, computing mathematical calculations, and considering

203.75 (6 11.56) after training (p = 0.031).. When correlating the
domains separately in the pre- and post-moments, it was observed that
behavior and attitude had a strong correlation with r = 0.956 (p =
0.044) in the pretraining and r = 0.827 (p = 0.173) in the
post-training, as shown in Table IX. Although statistical significance
was observed only in the pre-training, this result is also evidenced in
other studies Chappin et al. (2017), which use the same methodological
procedures. Given this, it can be said that it is likely that Teacher D
did not change his behavior, even after his participation in the
research. However, this (like the others) acquired knowledge on the
subject. According to Chappin et al. (2017), knowledge helps in more
sustainable attitudes and behaviors, but it is not a guarantee that
people will actually change habits and behavior through knowledge.

## 22.1 abstract

This paper reports a study conducted to investigate social studies and
science teachers’ awareness on climate change and how the professional
development workshop “Awareness and Adaptation to Climate Change”
affects teachers’ awareness level. For this purpose, a total of 101
teachers from 8 different cities and 4 geographical locations
participated in the workshop and took part in the study. For data
collection purposes, the Awareness to Climate Change Questionnaire
(ACCQ) was used. The analysis revealed no statistical difference among
participating teachers’ awareness level based on pre-test scores.
However, further analysis indicates an increase in awareness on climate
change among participating teachers upon completion of the professional
development workshops.

familiarize teachers with the workshop programs as well as faculty
members and facilities. Each day of the workshop was organized around a
special theme. First day: ecology and environmental problems that we
face mostly in the last century, especially global warming and
sustainable development. Second day: climate change, its impacts and
consequences for us and the ways to be followed for adaptation and
mitigation. Third day: energy including the subtopics of efficient ways
of energy consumption and sustainable energy resources in the world. The
workshops were structured around instruction, discussions, hands on

ANOVA results revealed that there were no statistical differences among
the four groups in terms of climate change awareness before the training
F (3, 97) = 0.525, p = 0.66. there was a statistically significant
difference between the mean scores of science and social science
teachers’ overall awareness to climate change before and after the
in-service training. The eta-squared statistics 0.31 indicated a
moderate effect size (Cohen, 1988). Having established that there was a
statistically significant difference, the mean values were examined to
find which set of scores were higher (ACC1 or ACC2). The pre-test mean
scores of overall climate change awareness was calculated 3.31 meaning
that the teachers reported that they were aware of the topic. The
post-test mean score was calculated as 3.84 indicating a stronger
awareness presented in Table 5. Based on the calculated mean values and
t-test analysis, a statistically significant increase was found between
pre- and post-test scores of the participating teachers.

## 23.1 abstract

Formal schooling frequently lacks both democratic learning culture and
effective climate change education (CCE). This study analyzes the
effects of the participatory CCE initiative k.i.d.Z.21 and the impacts
of the current Fridays For Future (FFF) climate protests on teenagers’
climate change awareness. The mixed-methods approach comprises online
pre-and post-tests, and personal interviews with selected students.
k.i.d.Z.21 follows moderate constructivist, inquiry-based learning
approaches and addresses 14-year old students from secondary schools in
Austria and southern Germany. Considering the effectiveness of the CCE
intervention of school year 2018/2019 (N = 169), quantitative findings
reveal an increased mean of major components of climate change
awareness, including climate-friendly behavior. When separating
participants and non-participants in Fridays For Future, personal
concern and refusing meat have both increased significantly only among
protest participants. A closer examination of this group identifies an
enhanced feeling of self-efficacy that might be triggered by perceived
collective efficacy. Besides, more climate-friendly consumption
behavior, as well as enhanced multiplicative action, are detected. The
interviewed students also clearly assigned increased action-related
components of climate change awareness to the attendance of FFF. From
the findings, we conclude that democratic learning in and out of school
can enhance action-related components of climate change awareness, and a
combination of both can have an even stronger effect.

## 24.1 abstract

Project-based climate change instructional modules were developed and
used in middle and high school classrooms. The modules were created to
develop higher-order thinking skills with real-world data and models
describing climate systems and approaches to mitigate or adapt to
changes. The objective of this paper is to identify the relationships
between specific attributes of the project-based climate modules used in
classrooms and resulting gains in middle and high school students’
climate literacy. Modules were assessed to define the level of rigor and
relevance associated with the learning activities. A climate literacy
questionnaire that included cognitive, affective (including
self-efficacy), and behavioral items was administered to students before
and after the modules were taught. Overall, students made modest but
statistically significant gains on the cognitive (p ≪ 0.001) and the
affective (p \< 0.01) climate literacy subscales. Results of the fixed
effects analysis of covariance showed a significant difference among
classrooms on students’ cognitive (p \< 0.001), behavioral (p = 0.001),
and self-efficacy (p = 0.015) performance; both the teacher and the
specific content taught varied among classrooms. Two specific teachers
and the modules they developed and taught were defined as exemplars
based on the significant climate literacy gains made by their students.
Both of these modules, one middle school level and one high school
level, used roleplay projects that expected students to acquire and
analyze historical temperature data and predictions of the future
climate at various locations around the world. Middle school students
played the role of an individual living in a different country and
culture, while the high school students each acted as a science adviser
to a political delegate attending a world climate conference. Students
at both levels made highly significant gains in the cognitive subscale,
and the middle school students improved their literacy in the affective,
self-efficacy, and behavioral subscales. The breadth of climate issues
covered and the depth of analysis of real-world data and situations were
identified as critical attributes of these particular modules that led
to improved climate literacy. © 2014 National Association of Geoscience

At an Extension youth agricultural science center, our team developed
and pilot tested a five-lesson weather and climate science curriculum
for middle school-aged youths. As part of the endeavor, we conducted an
item analysis of the five worksheets used across the lessons and
determined relationships between worksheet scores and pretest/posttest
science comprehension improvement scores. Results from 88 primarily
Hispanic eighth graders indicated that worksheet performance was related
to overall science comprehension, science knowledge, and weather and
climate resiliency in agriculture and natural resources lesson
improvement scores. Results support the use of formative scaffolding
tools such as worksheets in Extension youth programming to improve youth
science comprehension.

## 26.1 abstract

The researchers developed a youth weather and climate curriculum using a
science comprehension model that integrates experiential and
inquiry-based learning approaches with developing science knowledge,
science skills, and reasoning abilities. The purpose of this study was
to pilot the curriculum to determine if it would improve youth science
comprehension. Participants were 8th grade, predominately Hispanic and
economically disadvantaged youths, at a middle school in Las Vegas, New
Mexico served by an innovative Extension youth agricultural science
center. Youths were taught five weather and climate science lessons that
included setting up experiments and developing and testing hypotheses
for local climate trends from online weather station data. After being
taught the curriculum, youths improved in overall science comprehension
and its subdimensions of science knowledge, science skills, and
reasoning abilities. Their science comprehension also improved for four
of five lessons. The number of youths preferring learning by doing over
other learning modalities also increased from pretest to posttest.
Youths most frequently mentioned the experiments, that the earth is
getting warmer, and the greenhouse effect and gasses when asked what
interested them about the lessons. Pilot test results were used to
strengthen the curriculum before making it available to educators
online. Further research is recommended to establish the curriculum’s
impact on science comprehension retention and on science comprehension
development when the curriculum is used as part of an elementary to
secondary learning progression.

## 27.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing society,
and climate change educational models are emerging in response. This
study investigates the implementation and enactment of a climate change
professional development (PD) model for science educators and its impact
on student learning. Using an intrinsic case study methodology, we
focused analytic attention on how one teacher made particular
pedagogical and content decisions, and the implications for student’s
conceptual learning. Using anthropological theories of conceptual
travel, we traced salient ideas through instructional delivery and into
student reasoning. Analysis showed that students gained an increased
understanding of the enhanced greenhouse effect and the implications of
human activity on this enhanced effect at statistically significant
levels and with moderate effect sizes. However, students demonstrated a
limited, though non-significant gain on the likely effects of climate
change. Student reasoning on the tangible actions to deal with these
problems also remained underdeveloped, reflecting omissions in both PD
and teacher enactment. We discuss implications for the emerging field of
climate change education.

geological history. - lessons on the difference between weather and
climate and the carbon cycle - lessons with demonstrations
(experimental) on ice melt and thermal expansion - argumentative
activity using concept cartoons, where groups of students chose
different perspectives, conducted their own research, and discussed the
strengths and weaknesses of that position. - discussion on the effects
of climate change both locally and globally with introduced personal
changes, like driving less and planting trees, that her students could
take to influence their own carbon footprint

## 29.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today’s
global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely
covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available
through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in
its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially
non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a
crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become
climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50,
2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal
discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their
learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This
includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex
scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to
reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as
values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused
on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding
about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and
decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although
there is evidence that “knowledge” does not guarantee pro-environmental
behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2),
191-217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate
change is an important prerequisite to change individuals’ attitudes
towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate
citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual
understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning
environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to
support senior high school students’ learning about climate change and
possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different
concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated
concept maps, as well as on students’ test performance with respect to
conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and
socioscientific decision making.

## 32.1 abstract

Up until now, very few models conceptualizing students’ competence in
evaluation, argu-mentation and discourse in the context of science
education have been proposed. Most sug-gestions for analyzing this
particular competence in students are normative and the empiri-cal
support for them remains weak. The problem becomes even more severe when
such evaluations include ethical and societal perspectives as part of
the analytical parameters. In support of this topic, this paper presents
two approaches for handling students’ evaluation capabilities in the
context of multidimensional discussion situations. One approach focuses
on the quality of learners’ arguments concerning levels of
justification; the second reflects upon the quality of pupils’
complexity of argumentation. Both approaches were created us-ing group
discussion data collected for evaluation purposes. The data stems from a
curricu-lum innovation project focusing on the teaching of climate
change in four teaching do-mains: Biology, Chemistry, Physics and
Politics. Participants from 20 different learning groups conducted
semi-structured, pre- and post-group discussions on the issue of climate
change. Analysis of a total of 76 group discussions showed positive
potential in both evalu-ation grids on the topic. © 2012 IJESE.

## 33.1 abstract

Policy options for mitigating climate change have been severely limited
in the USA by the clash of competing ideologies. People who oppose
policies to mitigate climate change have successfully framed climate
change as existing outside the realm of fact and empirical reality.
Instead, opponents frame the issue as a melodramatic struggle between
good and evil. While scientists and engineers tend to be uncomfortable
with melodramatic framing, we argue that melodrama resonates with
people. Constructing a different melodramatic frame can tap into
people’s tendency to conceptualize issues in terms of heroes and
villains and assist in creating a shift in the political controversy
from debating the factuality of climate change to a focus on mitigation.
We developed an educational video game that uses this frame to teach
students about climate change and carbon capture, and sequestration, to
create an understanding of CO2 as the villain and humans as heroes
through participation in mitigation strategies. The hero of this
melodrama is aided by science and technology to mitigate anthropogenic
climate change. We analyze The Adventures of Carbon Bond (c) as a medium
for educating students about climate change and shifting framing. We
begin with a discussion of melodrama and the rhetorical nature of video
games. Then, through statistical analysis of surveys completed by
students who played the game, we demonstrate that students experienced a
knowledge increase as a result of game play. We conclude by discussing
the implications of our findings for productively reframing climate
change towards an emphasis on technological mitigation. (c) 2012 Society

the narrative of the game creates a melodramatic frame that focuses on
climate change mitigation by positioning players as heroes through
capturing and sequestering villainous CO2 molecules. The storyline of
the game focuses on a main character, Carbon Bond, who is on a mission
to save the planet by capturing as many rogue CO2 molecules as possible
and sequestering them in an underground formation. Being a CO2 molecule
himself, Bond separates himself from anthropogenic CO2 at the beginning
of the story by claiming to be naturally formed’ through the carbon
cycle, thus distinguishing for players the difference between natural
CO2 and CO2 from industrial operations. Bond’s adventures take him from
the smokestacks of an integrated gasification combined cycles power
plant, to the stormy coasts of the Gulf of Mexico (impacted by increased
storm intensity related to climate change), and finally to a CO2 storage
facility in the Southern Rockies where the Greenhouse Gas Gang
(anthropogenic GHGs) is locked away. The narrative begins with the
assumption that climate change is a factual problem that needs to be
solved, offers CCS as a technological solution to mitigating climate
change, and positions players to be a part of the solution by capturing
and sequestering CO2 molecules. Following a melodramatic frame, the game
presents anthropogenic CO2 as the villain and players (through the game
persona of Carbon Bond) as the heroes.

Ever-increasing global warming has created a societal imperative to
reach and engage youth, whose futures are at risk. In this paper, we
evaluate the climate science knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behavior and
communication impact of an entertainment-education high school assembly
program in a random sample of 49 schools (from population of 779 that
received the intervention) and a panel of 1,241 students. Pre- and
post-assembly surveys composed of questions from the Global Warming’s
Six Americas segmentation and intervention-specific measures were
administered in classrooms. We demonstrate that exposure to climate
science in an engaging edutainment format changes youths’ knowledge,
beliefs, involvement, and behavior positively and moves them to audience
segments that are more engaged in the issue. The net impact of scaled,
multi-sensory, captivating programs for youth could be a population
shift in science-informed engagement in the issue of climate change. In
addition, such programs can inspire youth for deeper engagement in
school programs, personal action, and political and consumer advocacy.

Alliance for Climate Education (ACE) delivered a standardized, 50-min
entertainment-education presentation on climate science to 779 high
schools during the 2011–2012 school year. The content was based on the
latest scientific sources (e.g., IPCC 2007) and followed the Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States 2013). Presentations took
place in assemblies held in gymnasiums or auditoriums. Presenters were
full-time ACE staff who memorized the script and passed a test of
climate knowledge to ensure they could answer follow-up questions.

As shown in Table 2, students’ knowledge of climate science, positive
engagement in the issue of climate change, and all short-term behaviors
(except carrying a reusable water bottle) Climatic Change (2014)
increased significantly after attending the ACE assembly. Effect sizes
were largest for knowledge of climate science (r=0.50) and for two of
the measures of positive engagement in the climate change issue—beliefs
measured by the Global Warming’s Six Americas index and self-efficacy
for explaining global warming to others or starting a conservation
project at school (r=0.49 and 0.42, respectively). Before the assembly,
students on average marked correct answers for just over half
(mean=5.13, SD=2.49) of the ten knowledge questions. After the assembly,
students on average answered 6.52 questions correctly (SD=2.76,
t(1,240)=20.49, p \<0.001). The Global Warming’s Six Americas index
increased over a quarter of a point on a response scale ranging from 1
to 5 (t(1,240)=19.97, p\<0.001). Selfefficacy increased from just under
the mid-point of the ten-point scale to just over the midpoint (4.30 to

## 35.1 abstract

Science education can build a bridge between research carried out by
scientists and relevant learning opportunities for students. The Broader
Impact requirements for scientists by funding agencies facilitate this
connection. We propose and test a model curriculum development process
in which scientists, curriculum developers, and classroom educators work
together to scaffold the use of authentic, unprocessed scientific data
for high school students. We outline a three-module curriculum structure
that facilitates these goals. This curriculum engages students in the
collection, description, visualization, and interpretation of data;
develops understanding of the nature of science; includes prompts to
develop higher-order thinking skills; builds knowledge of regional
relevance of climate change in students; uses active learning
techniques; and can be easily integrated with the Next Generation
Science Standards. The curriculum was reviewed and tested in the
classroom. To shed further light on the curriculum development process,
we gathered reflection data from the scientists, curriculum developers,
and educators. Scientists appreciated the collaborative process in which
they contributed their expertise without requiring a large time
commitment or strong expertise in science education. The curriculum
developers viewed the modular structure as helpful in breaking
complicated scientific concepts into teachable steps. Classroom
educators appreciated the detailed description and step-by-step
instructions to navigate data analysis tools like Excel or Google Earth.
Initial classroom implementation of the curriculum by 11 teachers with
over 1,100 students showed high levels of interest in the topic and
engagement. Further work is needed to assess efficacy of the curriculum
through classroom observations and measures of student learning. © 2015

## 36.1 abstract

This study investigates the influence of knowledge on opinions about
climate change in the emerging adults’ age group (16-17 years).
Furthermore, the effects of a lecture in climate change science on
knowledge and opinions were assessed. A survey was conducted in Austria
and Denmark on 188 students in national and international schools before
and after a lecture in climate change science. The results show that
knowledge about climate change science significantly affects opinions
about climate change. Students with a higher number of correct answers
are more likely to have the opinion that humans are causing climate
change and that both individuals and governments are responsible for
addressing climate change. The lecture in climate change science
significantly improved knowledge development but did not affect
opinions. Knowledge was improved by 11 % after the lecture. However, the
percentage of correct answers was still below 60 % indicating an urgent
need for improving climate change science education.

## 37.1 abstract

Preparing students for their future and qualifying them to enter public
life is the essential role of the public-school system. As such, an
understanding of climate science ought to be an essential-and
significant component of that preparation. This research proposes a
novel pathway to teach climate science via a 3D interactive digital game
and examines the potential of 12-13-year olds as a prepatent group for
climate science interventions. After playing a proof-of-concept climate
science game that covers the physical causes and mechanisms of climate
change, 401 students in Austria and Australia were tested with a climate
literacy questionnaire. Our results indicate that climate literacy can
be improved in this age group via the digital game. In addition, we
found further evidence of established climate science ‘knowledge
domains’ in this age group that form a natural ‘increased levels of
complexity’ scaffold that can be used to design curricula such as that
in the digital game. These four ‘knowledge domains’ are (in brief):
Earth in the solar system; gravity and its effect on the atmosphere;
albedo and solar radiation, and; greenhouse gases and their warming
potential.

The narrative for CO2peration follows the journey of a photon as it
visits the Rocky Planets in search of answers as to why Earth has liquid
water on its surface. After working with friendly orbital space probes
(i.e., Messenger, Magellan, Viking I & II, etc.) to collect data (e.g.,
composition of planet/surface temperature samples/diameter of planet),
the photon begins modelling the molecules that it finds along the way.
After reaching Mars, the photon returns to Earth where it explores the
role of albedo on Earth’s global mean surface temperature (GMST);
observing the effect from the Exosphere and then testing it in an
atmospheric-tank simulation (altering all relevant variables to observe
outcomes). Earth’s atmosphere is then investigated by the photon to
understand the role that each of Earth’s atmospheric layers has in
allowing us to understand climate phenomena (e.g., research on the
International Space Station in the Thermosphere/data from orbital
satellites in the Exosphere) and the role each layer plays in the
protection and maintenance of life (e.g., burning-up of meteors in the
Mesosphere/weather in the troposphere/ozone in the stratosphere) and
other atmospheric phenomena (e.g. auroras). Both game versions were
played in the native language of instruction (English in Australia and
German in Austria) and the game contents were translated by a certified
English-German translator.

## 39.1 abstract

The climate change community has begun to look carefully at how the
public understands, or fails to understand, climate change and the
scientific claims made based on data. This study focuses on how teachers
provide scaffolding that supports students’ understanding of, not only
how climate systems work or the causes and effects of climate change,
but also how we know what we know. Stanford’s Global Climate Change:
Professional Development for K-12 Teachers project provided teacher
professional development on the science of global climate change,
curricular materials, and pedagogical strategies. We conducted an
in-depth study of the classrooms of the participating teachers. Our
results show statistically significant gains from pre- to postassessment
in students’ content knowledge and a shift in their opinions about
climate change. These gains are positively related to the percentage of
students who are engaged and interacting, and negatively related to the
percentage of students who are disengaged. Through classroom
observations and video recordings, we identify how teachers and students
talk about how we know about climate change, and we discuss how that
talk can be enhanced. © 2014 National Association of Geoscience

about their own connection to climate change. Students then learn about
the Earth’s energy budget (Section 2) and greenhouse gases (Section 3)
to understand how excess carbon dioxide, with its ability to bsorb and
reradiate heat, is rapidly changing the climate Section 3 ends with
students looking at sources and sinks of carbon dioxide so that they
realize that climate change is almost certainly caused mostly by humans.

## 40.1 abstract

With the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged to promote strategies
and policies to substantially reduce their carbon emissions. To align
public sentiment with potentially expensive climate mitigation policy,
climate change education is considered an essential tool in tackling
climate change, particularly for the young generation. However, a
general lack of engagement is driven by the perception that climate
change is irrelevant at local and individual scales. Based on a modified
version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, we implemented a new climate
change educational programme, in 12 rural areas of China, where
adolescents communicated with local seniors (aged aeyen 60 years) in
focus groups to discuss local climate over the past decades. Seniors’
memories of extreme climatic events generally were in concordance with
meteorological data. The adolescents’ uncertainty about climate change
exhibited significant change after the programme, followed by concern,
risk perception, and perceived behavioural control. Based on mediation
analysis, the shift in adolescent concern and perceived behavioural
control translated into greater willingness to support climate change
mitigation. Thus, we suggest that climate change education should
emphasize place-based strategies that highlight the relevance of global
climate change through local impacts and individual experiences
vis-a-vis inter-generational communication to promote greater engagement
with climate change.

positively predict the changes in intention in model 3 (Table 1). The
changes in perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, and place
attachment were also strong predictors of changes in intention. However,

## 41.1 abstract

This paper reports on a study in which students used agent-based
computer models to learn about complex systems ideas of relevance to
understanding climate change. The experimental condition used a
Productive Failure (PF) learning design in which ninth grade students
initially worked with agent-based computer models to solve challenge
problems followed by teacher instruction about targeted climate and
complexity ideas. In contrast, the comparison condition employed a
Direct Instruction (DI) learning design in which the teacher instruction
was provided initially, followed by the students working on the same
computer models and challenge problems as the experimental group. The
students in the PF group scored significantly higher on the post-test on
measures of climate and complex systems explanatory knowledge and near
and far knowledge transfer. Theoretical and practical implications of
these findings are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

## 42.1 abstract

Science educators have called for using the learning progression
approach to align curriculum, instruction, and assessment. In line with
this trend, we conducted both assessments and teaching experiments with
students from grades 4 to 12 (717 students participated in the
pre-assessments and 682 students participated in the post-assessments).
The goal of the study is to develop a learning progression framework
that provides effective guidance for curriculum and instruction on
carbon-transforming processes in socio-ecological systems. We conducted
the study in three research cycles. We developed a matter-and-energy
learning progression framework during the first two cycles. This
learning progression framework was used to guide the teaching
intervention in the third research cycle. Clinical interviews and
written assessments were implemented before and after the teaching
intervention. In the process of data analysis, we found that the
matter-and-energy learning progression framework did not provide a
fine-grained depiction of students’ reasoning. Therefore, we developed
the five-practice learning progression framework, and used it to
re-analyze data. Results indicate that the teaching intervention has
helped students to achieve significant learning gains, but it was not
effective enough in helping students achieve the upper anchor of the
learning progression frameworkconstructing sophisticated scientific
explanations. The results also indicate that students tended to rely on
coherent and consistent reasoning to construct explanations. Based on
the findings, we provide instructional suggestions and discuss the
implications for climate change education and learning progression
research.

## 43.1 abstract

Purpose: Climate change education and the emotional consequences this
topic raises in the classroom has been largely ignored by researchers.
This paper considers the emotional response to climate education in a
primary classroom (age 9-10 years) in England and begins to explore the
emotions that teaching about climate change may raise for both teacher,
researcher and pupil. Design: Part of a long-term ethnographic project
in a school in England. Analysis of c60, 9-10-year olds drawings,
participant observation notes and research diaries. Limitations: This is
a small study-further research with larger numbers, different ages and
in different geographical regions are required with both pupils and
teachers. Practical implications: This work identifies pedagogies that
allow injustices children identify to be explored with emotional
responses being navigated rather than ignored. Such approaches support
wellbeing in the face of growing numbers of young people suffering from
eco-anxiety. © 2021, sowi-online e.V.. All rights reserved.

## 45.1 abstract

Climate change generally and global warming specifically have become a
common feature of the daily news. Due to widespread recognition of the
adverse consequences of climate change on human lives, concerted
societal effort has been taken to address it (e.g. by means of the
science curriculum). This study was designed to test the effect that
child-centred, 5E learning cycle-based climate change activities would
have over more traditional teacher-centred activities on Malaysian Year
5 primary students (11 years). A quasi-experimental design involving a
treatment (n = 55) and a group representing typical teaching method (n =
60) was used to measure the effectiveness of these activities on (a)
increasing children’s knowledge about global warming; (b) changing their
attitudes to be more favourable towards the environment and (c) identify
the relationship between knowledge and attitude that exist in this
study. Statistically significant differences in favour of the treatment
group were detected for both knowledge and environmental attitudes.
Non-significant relationship was identified between knowledge and
attitude in this study. Interviews with randomly selected students from
treatment and comparison groups further underscore these findings.
Implications are discussed.

  (Mcont 1⁄4 32.9, SDcont 1⁄4 4.29)
- The third hypothesis states that there would be no significant
  correlation between pro-environmental attitude and knowledge about
  global warming of the treatment group students based on the post-test
  results. This null hypothesis was not rejected at the chosen a-levels
  (r(53) 1⁄4 0.285; p 1⁄4 .035) suggesting that there was no significant
  correlation between understanding about global warming and
  pro-environmental attitude. Qualitative:
- $$Contrary to students in the control group$$ The students in the
  treatment group provided brief, but specific and knowledgeable
  responses. When asked about the causes for global warming, the
  treatment students showed that two weeks after the unit, they made
  appropriate connections
- Consistent with the quantitative results, students in the treatment
  group expressed more pro-environmental attitudes. Compared to the
  students from the comparison group, the interview responses reflected
  somewhat more positive attitudes together with self-reported changes

Existing studies report on secondary school students’ misconceptions
related to climate change; they also report on the methods of teaching
as reinforcing misconceptions. This quasi-experimental study was
designed to test the null hypothesis that a curriculum based on
constructivist principles does not lead to greater understanding and
fewer misconceptions on acid rain, global warming, greenhouse effect,
and ozone layer depletion than the traditional Malaysian curriculum. For
this purpose, two classes from two different schools were randomly
assigned to experimental (N = 35) and control condition (N = 38).
Following the intervention, an ANCOVA with pre-test as the covariate
showed statistically significant differences in understanding for all
four topics; additional interviews with randomly selected students from
experimental and control group further underscore the findings.
Implications are discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

## 47.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most important environmental issues
affecting our society today and we need to educate the citizens about
the impact on human lives. An attempt was made to integrate
experiential-based climate change education into the teaching and
learning of secondary school Biology lessons on the topic of Endangered
Ecosystem to improve students’ knowledge on climate change and increase
motivation towards caring for the environment. Two classes from a school
were randomly assigned to experimental (N = 30) and control groups (N =
32). Following the intervention, a one-way analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) with pre-test data as covariate showed statistically
significant differences in knowledge and motivation. Experiential-based
climate change activities enabled students to construct the knowledge
socially and also satisfied the three basic human needs: competence,
autonomy and relatedness, which have subsequently promoted motivation.
The findings described in this study are similar with other studies
which reported that constructivist-based experiential learning has
successfully developed awareness and encouraged learning and critical
thinking about climate change. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as

discussion, analysis of global climate change data - third lesson:
interactive presentation regarding greenhouse effect, experiments with
plastic bottles (temperature) - fourth lesson: climate change in local
and global community, climate change card game, lessons on climate
change effect - fifth lesson: carbon footprint calculation - sixth
lesson: role playing (minister, architect, teacher, doctor, student,
farmer, businessman, environmentalist, town planner and policeman) Each
group had to discuss and present how they could reduce the impact of
climate change globally and locally. Control treatment: In the control
group, the students were taught about climate change and how climate
change endangered our ecosystem as presented in the Form Four Biology
curriculum specifications (CDC, 2006), using their Ministry of Education
certified textbooks. During the lessons, the teacher used the chalk and

students’ knowledge about climate change after controlling the pre-test
scores. The partial eta-squared value of 0.599 indicates that 59.9% of
changes in the post-test were caused by the treatment. Motivation toward
the environment: - In the post-test from the results in Table 5, it is
clear that the students in the experimental group exhibited higher mean
values for the first three motivations: intrinsic, integrated and
identified compared to the control group. For th the experimental group
displayed higher increase than the control group students did. This
suggests that the treatment received by the experimental group students
resulted in the students having more pro-environmental motivation than
the control group students do.e other three subscales, introjected,
external and amotivation, both groups exhibited lower mean scores. This
shows that they improved on these three subscales. -

## 48.1 abstract

The COP21 Agreement 2015 sets very high targets, which cannot be reached
by political agreements or technological progress alone. Within this
context, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), and particularly
Climate Change Education (CCE), play an ever increasing role regarding a
holistic societal transformation towards a sustainable world. Creating
ESD/CCE learning settings and delivering scientific evidence for their
success has turned into a vital challenge in order to meet the high
expectations. In this longitudinal study, based on the research project
k.i.d.Z.21 - Competent into the Future, we deliver scientific evidence
of the success of CCE when based on transdisciplinary and/or moderate
constructivist theories, and show that the impact is even higher when
both approaches are combined. The data presented derive from scientific
surveys and tests, involving 343 teenagers before and after intensive
collaboration with a high number of experts, including renowned climate
change scientists.

## 49.1 abstract

The science of climate change is a complex subject to teach. Teachers
find climate change a challenging topic to teach due to a myriad of
reasons. Gayford, 2010 describes some of the challenges teachers face
while teaching climate change science as “first, the controversial
nature of the topic; second, it does not relate well to the normal
sequencing and division of topics within most science courses; and,
third, there are important non-scientific aspects to possible solutions
to the problem” (p.1191). This is a particular challenge for teachers
with a diverse population. This paper reports on teachers’ understanding
of climate change science concepts and how to teach science with a focus
on cultural relevance by participating in a three-year teacher
profession development program specifically for science teachers
teaching a large population of Native American students. Overall
teachers demonstrated gains in understanding of how scientists access
data to study climate impacts and how to present climate change science
concepts that tap into culturally relevant ways.

## 50.1 abstract

Climate change is the one of the most controversial issues in
environmental history since natural processes and human activities lead
to causation. This complexity often thwarts communication and education
efforts. Some research suggests that place-based approaches are
effective for delivering climate change instruction because they feature
local and observable impacts, thus connecting human behavior with
climate change. This study developed and evaluated the efficacy of a
place-based climate change education program using a one-group, pre and
posttest design. The study involved 29 high-school students who
participated in a one-week, summer education program at Prairie Fork
Conservation Area in mid-Missouri. Use of place-based education was
hypothesized to promote knowledge, awareness, responsibility, hope, and
behavioral intention of participants regarding climate change. Results
suggested that the program was an effective way to increase
understanding of climate change, as evidenced by significant increases
in a variety of measures. Implications for using place-based education
are discussed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Introduction: A poster was created that defined CC, how it works, its
causes (individual activities that accelerate change), the impacts in
Missouri, and some ways to become more climate friendly. II. Guided
hike: A guided hike was adapted from “Southern Forest and Climate Change
Activity 1: stepping through the climate science” (Monroe & Oxarart,
2014). During the hike, participants learned about some evidence of CC
in Missouri and how to identify it. III. Self reflection: The third item
in the toolkit was a “score card.” These cards consisted of list of
activities that reduce the impact of CC at home and other local
contexts, such as parks. It also listed a series of climate friendly
activities and a self-scoring rubric (0 1⁄4 never, 1 1⁄4 sometimes, 2

The Jersey Roots, Global Reach 4-H Climate Science Program conducted in
Camden, New Jersey introduces middle school students to the evidence,
impacts, and potential solutions to climate change. For their service
learning project, students installed two rain gardens at the school.
Rain gardens are shallow landscaped depressions in the soil that can be
installed at homes, parks, and schools and provide environmental
benefits by filtrating stormwater runoff. Created using native plants,
rain gardens are aesthetically pleasing and require minimal maintenance.

## 52.1 abstract

This study explored the impact of using a socioscientific issue (SSI)
based curriculum on developing science content knowledge. Using a
multi-level assessment design, student content knowledge gains were
measured before and after implementation of a three-week unit on global
warming (a prominent SSI) that explored both the relevant science
content and the controversy surrounding global warming. Measures of
student content knowledge were made using a standards-aligned content
knowledge exam (distal assessment) and a curriculum-aligned exam
(proximal assessment). Data were collected from 108 students enrolled
from two schools. Quantitative analysis of the distal assessment
indicated that student post-test scores were statistically significantly
different than their pre-test scores (F = 15.31, p\<0.001). Qualitative
analyses of student responses from the proximal assessment indicated
that students, on average, expressed more accurate, more detailed, and
more sophisticated understandings of global warming, the greenhouse
effect, and the controversy and challenges associated with these issues
following the three-week unit. Combined results from the proximal and
distal assessments explored in this study offer important evidence in
supporting the efficacy of using SSI as contexts for science education.
In addition to a discussion of the components of an SSI-based
curriculum, this study provides support for the use of SSI as a context
for learning science content. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

exercise highlighted the sociopolitical complexity of global warming.
The next three portions of the intervention provided opportunities to
explore the basic concepts underlying the science of global warming
through three consecutive laboratory exercises. In the sixth exercise,
students considered climate data and displays produced by the National

## 53.1 abstract

There has been an intensive debate in the field of climate change
education about what predictors influence youth’s climate-related
behavior and what educational strategies and practices stimulate such
behavior. This study investigated the impact of the ‘CO2 League’ program
which involved 47 schools (N = 123). For the analyses, we used
pre-/-post quasi-experimental design which combined quantitative and
qualitative methods: an extensive pre-/-post survey for analyzing
several components of students’ climate literacy
(system/action/effectiveness knowledge, climate change concern,
self-efficacy, willingness for climate-protective behavior) and focus
group interviews. The analyses revealed a significant impact of
sufficient climate change knowledge on climate change concern which
subsequently positively influenced participants’ self-efficacy and their
willingness to act. The findings of this study suggest that knowledge is
a key initial driver for climate action, especially for young people,
and confirm the conclusion of previous studies that willingness to adopt
pro-climatic behavior presupposes a clear and explicit understanding of
climate dynamics and its causal relations. The focus group interviews
also revealed that the reported increased willingness to act often
translated into actual climate action and that learning about the
concept of carbon footprint and the process of calculating and
decreasing it proved to be a very accessible and fast path to
participants’ engagement in personal climate action.

## 54.1 abstract

The grand challenges of the 21st century will increasingly require
societies to reconsider the pathways taken thus far. Engagement with
climate change is of ever-growing importance to young people. They will
be confronted with the effects of climate change throughout their entire
lives and, as future decision-makers,they will vitally shape societal
developments. Education will thus play a crucial role in the
transformation to a sustainable society. In terms of awareness-raising,
an important first step in preparing young people for the challenges of
the 21st century is to understand what content is connected with climate
change. As complex challenges, such as climate change, demand ways of
thinking that go beyond categories, interconnections between the
anthroposphere and the natural sphere have to be taken into
consideration. This study provides an insight into the questions and
topics young people develop whilst becoming involved in climate change
in an in-school learning setting and in an out-of-school learning
setting (a high mountain environment). The analysis focuses on the
question of in which spheres students predominantly make their thematic
choices and how far the interconnections between different spheres are
formed. Our results show that the choice of the learning setting
influences the topics students connect with climate change.
Interconnections between sub-spheres of the anthroposphere and natural
sphere are made only occasionally. These findings serve as a basis for
reconsidering the content and foundation of climate change communication
with young people. We recommend that climate change educational
programmes should include phases that allow the following: a)
involvement with climate change issues related to single spheres in the
first phase, and b) consideration of the interconnections between
spheres when becoming involved with climate change issues in the second
phase. As the educational setting can considerably influence the focus
of the teaming process, it should be chosen thoughtfully. (C) 2016

## 55.1 abstract

Climate change is not local; it is global. This means that many
environmental issues related to climate change are not geographically
limited and hence concern humans in more than one location. There is a
growing body of research indicating that today’s increased climate
change is caused by human activities and our modern lifestyle.
Consequently, climate change awareness and attention from the entire
world’s population needs to be a global priority and we need to work
collaboratively to attain a sustainable future. A powerful tool in this
process is to develop an understanding of climate change through
education. Recognizing this, climate change has been included in many
science curricula as a part of science education in schools. However,
teaching such a complex and global topic as climate change is not easy.
The research in this paper has been driven by this challenge. In this
paper, we will present our online science module called Global Climate
Exchange, designed with inquiry activities for international peer
collaboration to teach climate change. In this study, we engaged 157
students from four countries (Canada, China, Sweden, and Norway) to
collaborate in Global Climate Exchange. To explore the opportunities
that international peer collaboration in Global Climate Exchange gives,
we have analyzed how students develop their explanations about climate
change issues over time. Our analysis showed that the students increased
the proportion of relevant scientific concepts in relation to the total
number of words in their explanations and that they improved the quality
of links between concepts over a six-week period. The analysis also
revealed that the students explained more perspectives relating to
climate change issues over time. The outcomes indicate that
international peer collaboration, if successfully supported, can be an
effective approach to climate change education. © 2015 by iSER,

\"We have developed a science module \[on an internet platform$$ called
Global Climate Exchange. In Global Climate Exchange, students
collaborate with their peers from other countries $$here: Norway (only
ones analysed), China, Sweden, Canada$$ in online inquiry-based
activities. The module was designed as a scaffolding wiki, in other
words, as an online knowledge community where students were scaffolded
through activities, by tasks given by the designers and the teachers, to
explore and discuss climate change issues. In Global Climate Exchange,
students were guided to collaborate with their peers through four
different activities: Brainstorm activity, Issue activity, Discussion
activity, and Chat activity, during a 6-week period - Brainstorm
activity: During the first week, the students worked on the brainstorm
activity, where they identified national climate change issues, added
these to a Google Map developed specifically for this activity, and
described the issues on a brainstorm page. Through this activity, the
students started to communicate national and local climate change issues
to their peers. After finishing this activity, the students’ work was
examined by teachers and researchers to identify global issues that were
relevant for further elaboration in the subsequent activities - Issue
activity : After the brainstorm activity, each student was assigned to
one of the twelve climate change issues, building groups containing
students from different countries. The students’ task was, in
collaboration, to investigate and describe their climate change issue
further; more specifically, they were asked to describe the issue, give
relevant examples from their own countries, and explain the science
related to the issue. - Discussion activity: Still working in their
groups from the issue activity, the students were introduced to a
discussion activity. The discussions were initiated by questions posed
by the designers and teachers about climate change topics: “What is
‘Global’ in Global Climate Change?”, “How can changes in your lifestyle
improve climate change?”, “What could be done?”, “What has been done?”,
and “What might happen if we do nothing?” - Chat activity: Embedded in
Global Climate Exchange there was also the option for students to, at
any time, create a chat room. There was no guidance provided for the use
of chat rooms in Global Climate Exchange, except for some ethical rules,
which were monitored by researchers and teachers in each country.

- Use of concepts: The results show that the proportion of relevant
  scientific concepts in relation to the total number of words used in
  the explanation increased on average from 0.16 in the first week to
  0.20 in the last week. The proportion of concepts that the students
  used in their explanations varied from 0.12 to 0.36 between students,
  whereas there was less variation within each student’s explanation
  over time. The greatest difference was between the students’ use of
  concepts in the first week (SD = 0.13), which declined to 0.8 in week
  2, and then to 0.6 from week 3 to week 6.
- Link quality between concepts: The first week had links in students’
  explanations that were dominated by low quality:
  weak/irrelevant/misunderstood. The proportion of low quality links
  decreased in the third week and remained stable until week 6.
- Variety of perspectives on the studied issues: Six perspectives were
  identified in the students’ initial explanations: cause, evidence,
  mechanism, predicted consequence, remediation, and adaptation. In the
  first week, students focused mostly on explaining predicted
  consequences (37%). In week 6, the students focused similarly on
  predicted consequences (29%), evidence (27%), and mechanisms (23%).
  The number of perspectives explained increased until week 3, and then
  became stable until week 6. On average, the students explained three
  perspectives in week 6, but it varied from one to four.
- Quality of causal patterns: In the sixth week, a large majority of the
  students’ explanations were categorized as Medium (n = 11) or
  Medium–high (n = 5). Compared to the first week, this is an increase
  of 41%. It is also worth noting that none of the students’
  explanations was at Medium–high in the first week, whereas almost a
  third were in this category by week 6. These students developed their
  explanations in terms of describing multiple causes and effects, and
  by describing how these causal relationships were a part of the whole
  system. More than half of the students (n = 11) ended up having a
  medium quality to their explanations of climate change issues, meaning
  that they identified multiple linear causalities involving multiple
  indirect connections, used a variety of concepts, and linked them
  properly together as valuable examples or complementary information,
  and they described at least three perspectives for climate change
  issues. Second question: is the quality of student explanations linked
  to the peer interactions in the platform:
- Twelve of 19 students developed their explanations in terms of
  advancement; for example, they better explained causalities using
  scientific concepts, by linking concepts together, and explaining
  their perspectives regarding climate change issues. These students
  interacted with their peers three times more often on average compared
  to those who did not advance. `{=html}     </td>` `{=html}     </tr>`

Latest findings of the IPCC highlight the fact that there is an urgent
need for climate action on both individual and societal levels, because
political regulations and technical advances just would not be enough to
counter climate change. Acknowledging young people’s role as present and
future decision-makers, their engagement is absolutely imperative in
order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 13, “Climate Action.”
Therefore, new methods of teaching and learning are necessary, and they
need to encourage transformative learning, which, it is assumed, will
lay foundations for transformative engagement. Research in the field of
science education credits scientific literacy vision III as fostering
transformative learning and engagement. In this study, transdisciplinary
education is analyzed as a promising concept that enables exchange of
knowledge, experiences, and perspectives between students and scientific
partners while they jointly complete research on real-world issues. A
quantitative analysis capturing scientific literacy and transformative
engagement for climate action of Austrian and German secondary school
students (N = 162) is carried out alongside a literature review. This
study reveals that the didactical concept of transdisciplinary education
notably contributes to the implementation of scientific literacy vision
III as well as vision II. According to the results, the three visions of
scientific literacy are predictors for transformative engagement for
climate action, assuming to be preceded by a transformative learning
process. These encouraging findings need to be replicated by further
scholars in other contexts.

## 57.1 abstract

Providing children with a clear understanding of climate change drivers
and their mitigation is crucial for their roles as future earth
stewards. To achieve this, it will be necessary to reverse the declining
interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)
education in schools in the UK and other countries, as STEM skills will
be critical when designing effective mitigation solutions for climate
change. The ‘Heat-Cool Initiative’ was co-designed and successfully
implemented in five primary/secondary UK schools, as a playful learning
tool to unleash student interest in STEM subjects. 103 students from two
cohorts (years 5-6 and 7-9) participated in five Heat-Cool activity
sessions where they used infrared cameras to explore the issue of urban
heat. Their learning was evaluated using a multi-functional quantitative
assessment, including pre-and post-session quizzes. Climate change
literacy increased by 9.4% in primary school children and by 4.5% in
second-ary school children. Analyses of \>2000 infrared images taken by
students, categorised into 13 common themes, revealed age-related
differences in children’s cognitive development. At primary school age,
images of the ‘self’ dominated; secondary school children engaged more
with their physical environment. This novel approach demonstrated the
importance of developing tailored technology-enhanced STEM education
programmes for different age cohorts, leading to a high capacity for
improving learning outcomes regarding climate change. Such programmes,
embedded in school curricula nationally and internationally, could
become a much-needed positive contribution to reaching the United
Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goals 4 (Quality
Edu-cation) and 13 (Climate Action).

## 58.1 abstract

Global climate change, referred to as climate change in this paper, has
become an important planetary issue, and given that K-12 students have
numerous alternative conceptions or lack of prior knowledge, it is
critical that teachers have an understanding of the fundamental science
underlying climate change. Teachers need to understand the natural and
human-induced factors affecting climate, and the potential consequences,
and ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This study focusses on
assessing preservice and inservice teachers’ knowledge about climate
change at the beginning and end of an instructional intervention
embedded in an elementary science methods course. This paper describes
the development of an instrument derived from the constructive modeling
approach framework. The four components of this approach (the construct
map, items design, outcome space, and measurement model) are discussed.
In addition, the instructional intervention is described along with
findings from the study and an analysis of the instrument.

## 59.1 abstract

Given the recent media attention on the public’s shift in opinion toward
being more skeptical about climate change, 154 preservice teachers’
participated in an intervention in an elementary science methods course.
Findings indicated that students developed a deeper level of concern
about climate change. Their perceptions on the evidence for climate
change, consensus of scientists, impacts of climate change, and
influence of politics also changed significantly. The curriculum and
instruction appear to be an important factor in increasing understanding
of climate change and developing perceptions more aligned to those of
climate scientists. More broadly, this study provides preliminary
support for the value of providing a careful framing of the topic of
climate change within the context of science methods courses. © 2013 The

## 60.1 abstract

The collective action that is required to mitigate and adapt to climate
change is extremely difficult to achieve, largely due to
socio-ideological biases that perpetuate polarization over climate
change(1,2). Because climate change perceptions in children seem less
susceptible to the influence of worldview or political contexts(3), it
may be possible for them to inspire adults towards higher levels of
climate concern, and in turn, collective action(4). Child-to-parent
intergenerational learning-that is, the transfer of knowledge, attitudes
or behaviours from children to parents(5)-may be a promising pathway to
over-coming socio-ideological barriers to climate concerns(5). Here we
present an experimental evaluation of an educational intervention
designed to build climate change concern among parents indirectly
through their middle school-aged children in North Carolina, USA.
Parents of children in the treatment group expressed higher levels of
climate change concern than parents in the control group. The effects
were strongest among male parents and conservative parents, who,
consistent with previous research(1), displayed the lowest levels of
climate concern before the intervention. Daughters appeared to be
especially effective in influencing parents. Our results suggest that
intergenerational learning may overcome barriers to building climate
concern.

## 62.1 abstract

How can youth become leaders in their communities’ resilience efforts?
The Lentes en Cambio Climatico (LECC) filmmaking program aimed to
empower students to investigate how a changing climate affects their
lives and use their own findings to inspire local resilience. Secondary
students in LECC created films that explore the experiences of community
members and document local knowledge around climate topics relevant to
their lives. A mixed-methods study measured the program impacts on
students. Results from summer implementations in 2018 and 2019 suggest
that participation in LECC increased students’ awareness, confidence,
and engagement around climate topics and their interest in contributing
to community resilience efforts. Additionally, by leading community
discussions during film screening events, students gained confidence in
their leadership roles, and ability to share their expertise with
parents and community members. These conversations appeared to both
empower students and amplify their voices as advocates for change in
their communities. Supplemental data for this article is available

## 63.1 abstract

Low levels of concern about anthropogenic climate change have been
attributed to a range of factors, some of which relate to education.
These include people’s lack of understanding and engagement with the
multifaceted nature and extent of the problem that it presents to
current and future generations. Limited knowledge is also known to be an
obstacle to individual behaviour change, with important implications for
young people’s perceptions of the urgency to act and awareness of the
consequences of their own behaviours. In this study, we explored ways to
address low levels of understanding about ocean science dimensions to
climate change phenomena, cognisant of a growing awareness that formal
education curricula do not adequately engage young people with
developing ocean literacy. Participants were a sample of secondary
school students (11 to 14 years) in Portugal and the UK. Using a
gamified mobile application, it was examined relationships between the
use of different game elements such as points, badges and leaderboards,
and learning outcomes. Systematic evaluation of each element shows how
different game features affected the participants’ learning experience
and learning outcomes. Implications for formal and informal marine
education, climate education, and how to improve ocean literacy efforts,
are also discussed.

## 64.1 abstract

As part of a large-scale instructional intervention research, this study
examined elementary students’ science knowledge and awareness of social
activism with regard to an increased greenhouse effect and global
warming. The study involved fifth-grade students from five elementary
schools of varying demographic makeup in a large urban school district
in the United States. The study was based on the analysis of students’
responses to a writing prompt addressing an increased greenhouse effect
and global warming at the beginning of and at the completion of
instruction over the school year. The results indicate that students
with adequate science knowledge tended to express activism more
frequently, and that their expression of activism increased as they
gained better science knowledge after the instruction. The results
highlight the importance of effective instruction of this contemporary
and controversial issue with K-12 students, so that they come to be
aware of this societal problem, take action in solving the problem, and
become socially responsible youth and adults.

## 65.1 abstract

This article takes its point of departure from the younger generation’s
problematic relationship with time and the future. A general sense of
changeability and directionlessness in society compromises young
people’s confidence in themselves to make a difference as individuals in
important global issues affecting their futures, such as climate change.
Given recent aims and commitments of science education to promote
sustainable development and student agency, this study explores how
science teaching can help students imagine and face possible future
scenarios and develop agency in the present to influence them. This
article presents a science education approach to equip secondary school
students with skills of futures thinking and agency that we call
“future-scaffolding skills.” It also shows the process of building an
operational definition for recognizing those skills in students’
discourse and actions. For this purpose, an empirical study was carried
out in the context of a teaching-learning module on climate change,
consisting of activities inspired by the field of futures studies.
Essays, individual and group interviews, questionnaires, and video
recordings of students’ final projects were collected from 24 students
(16-19-years old) from three European countries. The results contribute
to operationally defining “future-scaffolding skills,” consisting of
“structural skills” (the ability to recognize temporal, logical and
causal relationships and build systemic views) and “dynamical skills”
(the ability to navigate scenarios, relating local details to global
views, past to present and future, and individual to collective
actions).

## 66.1 abstract

Background: Evidence of the effectiveness of intervention against
extreme heat remains unclear, especially among children, one of the
vulnerable populations. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness
of a primary school-based intervention program against heatwave and
climate change in China to provide evidence for development of policies
for adaptation to climate change. Methods: Two primary schools in
Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province, China, were randomly selected as
intervention and control schools (CTR registration number:
ChiCTR2200056005). Health education was conducted at the intervention
school to raise students’ awareness and capability to respond to extreme
heat during May to September in 2017. Knowledge, attitude, and practice
(KAP) of students and their parents at both schools were investigated by
questionnaire surveys before and after intervention. The changes in KAP
scores after intervention were evaluated using multivariable
difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, controlling for age, sex, etc.
Results: The scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice of students and
their parents increased by 19.9% (95%CI: 16.3%, 23.6%) and 22.5% (95%CI:
17.8%, 27.1%); 9.60% (95%CI: 5.35%, 13.9%) and 7.22% (95%CI: 0.96%,
13.5%); and 9.94% (95%CI: 8.26%, 18.3%) and 5.22% (95%CI: 0.73%, 9.71%),
respectively, after intervention. The KAP score changes of boys were
slightly higher than those of girls. Older students had higher score
changes than younger students. For parents, the higher the education
level, the greater the score change, and change in scores was greater in
females than in males. All the health education activities in the
program were significantly correlated with the changes in KAP scores of
primary school students after intervention, especially those curricula
with interesting activities and experiential learning approaches.
Conclusions: Heat and health education program in primary school was an
effective approach to improve cognition and behavior for both students
and their parents to better adapt to heatwaves and climate change. The
successful experience can be generalized to respond to the increasing
extreme weather/climate events in the context of climate change, such as
heatwaves, and other emergent occasions or public health education, such
as the control and prevention of COVID-19.

## 68.1 abstract

The Transformative Experience Questionnaire (TEQ) has previously been
used only in formal science learning environments to examine how
students’ learning experiences extend beyond the classroom into their
daily lives. In the present study, an example of how this tool can be
useful to assess transformative experiences in an informal learning
program is provided. The Lens On Climate Change (LOCC) program combined
a place-based approach to learning with creative expression through
storytelling, as middle and high school participants created short films
about the impacts of climate change in their communities. Our findings
suggest the LOCC participants had a transformative experience with
regards to their learning about climate change as illustrated in greater
post-program TEQ scores over a comparison group of research participants
who did not engage in the LOCC program. The program was also
transformative for both middle and high school students. Results are
discussed within theoretical frameworks for designing informal
transformative science learning experiences.

## 69.1 abstract

This study explores in-service teachers’ attitudes and knowledge about a
pressing environmental issue, “global climate change” (GCC), and how
these may relate to their classroom teaching. In this work, nineteen
teachers from Native American communities attended a professional
development workshop that focused on enhancing their scientific
understanding and classroom teaching of GCC. Teachers’ responses to
surveys and interviews revealed that the majority of them considered GCC
as mainly human-induced and shared similar concerns about potential
consequences of GCC, but their specific ecological beliefs varied to
different degrees. Throughout the workshop, teachers became more aware
of the urgency of GCC and the importance of incorporating climate issues
into their science teaching. However, teachers’ attitudes and beliefs
about GCC were not strong indicators of their level of knowledge, as
misconceptions were sometimes found among teachers who were very
concerned about climate issues. This work opens up further discussions
on the relationship between individuals’ attitudes and knowledge about
environmental issues. More importantly, it provides important
implications for future professional development programs on climate
change education and proposes effective tools to evaluate teachers’
perspectives about GCC.

Plausibility is a central but under-examined topic in conceptual change
research. Climate change is an important soda-scientific topic; however,
many view human-induced climate change as implausible. When learning
about climate change, students need to make plausibility judgments but
they may not be sufficiently critical or reflective. The purpose of this
study was to examine how students’ plausibility judgments and knowledge
about human-induced climate change transform during instruction
promoting critical evaluation. The results revealed that treatment group
participants who engaged in critical evaluation experienced a
significant shift in their plausibility judgments toward the
scientifically accepted model of human-induced climate change. This
shift was accompanied by significant conceptual change postinstruction
that was maintained after a six-month delay. A comparison group who
experienced a climate change activity that is part of their normal
curriculum did not experience statistically significant changes. (c)

## 71.1 abstract

Education for sustainable development (ESD) is a holistic and
transformative form of education that seeks action-oriented pedagogy
using self-directed learning, participation, and collaboration, among
other aspects, and is suitable for developing active methodologies.
Since affective-emotional aspects can contribute in the
teaching-learning process, this work studies, through a case study, the
comparison of the influence of two active methodologies: Cooperative
Learning (CL) and Project-Based Learning (PBL) in student emotions and
learning processes, as well as their awareness of ESD. For that purpose,
a survey was conducted at the fourth secondary level in the science
laboratory, subjected to the innovation project e-WORLD, which developed
the content of the 7 and 13 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from
the 2030 Agenda. Results of ANOVA and Tukey’s tests carried out showed
that both methodologies improved skills and knowledge related to climate
change and energy, and triggered major positive emotions in students.
Furthermore, CL allowed students to acquire more individual and group
responsibility than communication skills developed with PBL. It is
necessary to continue working on the involvement of students in these
methodologies in order to improve their social skills and to reveal life
changes towards more socio-sustainable ones.

## 72.1 abstract

Across four studies, two controlled lab experiments and two field
studies, we tested the efficacy of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as an
education medium for teaching the consequences of climate change,
particularly ocean acidification. Over 270 participants from four
different learning settings experienced an immersive underwater world
designed to show the process and effects of rising sea water acidity. In
all of our investigations, after experiencing immersive VR people
demonstrated knowledge gains or inquisitiveness about climate science
and in some cases, displayed more positive attitudes toward the
environment after comparing pre- and post-test assessments. The analyses
also revealed a potential post-hoc mechanism for the learning effects,
as the more that people explored the spatial learning environment, the
more they demonstrated a change in knowledge about ocean acidification.
This work is unique by showing distinct learning gains or an interest in
learning across a variety of participants (high school, college
students, adults), measures (learning gain scores, tracking data about
movement in the virtual world, qualitative responses from classroom
teachers), and content (multiple versions varying in length and content
about climate change were tested). Our findings explicate the
opportunity to use immersive VR for environmental education and to drive
information-seeking about important social issues such as climate
change.

## 73.1 abstract

Summary: In environmental education the construction of appropriate
knowledge is not enough, but is undoubtedly a fundamental component of
individual and collective environmental responsiveness. The aim of this
study was to investigate fifth graders’ changes of conceptions about the
greenhouse effect and global warming, due to socio-cognitive interaction
developed in small and large group discussions in an authentic classroom
context during the implementation of an environmental education
curriculum unit. We hypothesized that a classroom transformed into a
community of discoursei.e. a learning environment which stimidates and
supports giving verbal explanations, comparing and critically evaluating
different points of view on the examined environmental phenomenon, would
be a fruitful breeding ground for knowledge revision. The results show
that classroom discussions, the core of the proposed learning activity,
led the children, although at different levels, to the integration of
new scientific knowledge into their conceptual ecology, based on the
personal revision of pre-instructional conceptions. As hypothesized, a
high positive correlation was found between conceptual change and
metaconceptual awareness of the changes in pre-existing representations
of the examined phenomenon. Some implications are drawn from the
standpoint of environmental education. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group,

## 74.1 abstract

Objective: Systems thinking can be counterintuitive to everyday ways of
knowing. This can surface doubt around predicted patterns of emergence
in complex systems data, especially as it relates to the current climate
crisis and related justice-oriented solutions. Method: Our study
describes a four-year design-based research project in which we engaged
high school biology students in complex systems modelling to understand
linkages between increasing ocean temperatures and the rate and severity
of disease outbreaks in sea stars. Results: Our findings showed that
students approached climate data with uncertainty and viewed their lives
as separate from the impacts of climate change. Through iterative design
work, youth used authentic data and computational tools to construct
geospatial and causal-loop models of climate-related disease outbreaks
that situated case studies within broader socioecological and
sociotechnical contexts of historic and powered human actions. Through a
speculative design lens, models were transformed from data visualization
tools to mediums for storying and re-storying present and future worlds
for multispecies survival in the face of the climate crisis. Conclusion:
Students shifted their understandings of disease outbreaks from a
technical perspective to a more social and situated lens of care and
responsibility for mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis on human
and more-than-human communities. KEY POINTS What is already known about
this topic: (1) Teachers that cover climate change often focus solely on
technical and data-based aspects during instruction, such as the carbon
cycle and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, without including the
social and political contexts through which the climate emergency
emerged. (2) Engaging students in meaningful action and problem-solving
creates positive affective outcomes and retains hope in students in the
face of future climate impacts. (3) There is still more that we need to
learn about how to design learning environments that cultivate hope,
agency, and multispecies caring in K-12 contexts. What this topic adds:
(1) We show how complex systems modelling and data visualization can
cultivate multispecies caring and climate action by situating
climate-related phenomena in larger socioecological and sociotechnical
systems. (2) Through a speculative design lens, we show how modelling
can be transformed from data visualization to storytelling and
re-storying present and future worlds that centre on ecological and
multispecies flourishing. Here we show a new ontological dimension of
modelling practices as future and world making. (3) Our research shows
how multispecies caring emerged as an action in this world, and for
creating the future worlds students wanted to see; it became an
affective dimension for making meaning amid the complexity and
uncertainty of the climate crisis. © 2022 Australian Psychological

ABSTRACTThis study reports on an effort to illustrate the coupling of
educational research with ongoing curriculum development to promote
effective and evidence-based online learning. The research findings have
been used to inform the EarthLabs curriculum development team as they
revise existing modules and create new modules, in order to represent
the ways in which such research findings can be used to improve similar
online curriculum materials and enhance student learning outcomes.
EarthLabs curriculum is a suite of online inquiry-based activities that
promote understanding of Earth system science. Assessments were employed
to understand student learning about complex climate systems as a result
of their engagement with the online EarthLabs curriculum. Collection of
pre- and postcourse student assessment data (n = 205), classroom
observations during implementation (n = 6), teacher interviews (n = 7),
and eye-tracking data (n = 49) were included in the study. Qualitative
and quantitative findings show that EarthLabs classroom implementation
significantly improves students’ conceptual and systems understanding
and that students and external users are appropriately engaged with the
online materials. These findings have been applied to evaluating the
efficacy of the EarthLabs program in reaching target programmatic and
learning goals, as well as to developing a broader understanding of the
cognitive challenges students have in navigating complex Earth systems
phenomena, where continued EarthLabs program revision has occurred
through design-based research.

## 76.1 abstract

This study investigates how the enactment of a climate change curriculum
supports students’ development of critical science agency, which
includes students developing deep understandings of science concepts and
the ability to take action at the individual and community levels. We
examined the impact of a four to six week urban ecology curriculum on
students from three different urban high schools in the USA. Data
collection included pre and posttest written assessments from all
students (n = 75) and pre and post interviews from focal students (n =
22) to examine how students’ conceptual understandings, beliefs and
environmental actions changed. Our analyses showed that at the beginning
of the curriculum, the majority of students believed that climate change
was occurring; yet, they had limited conceptual understandings about
climate change and were engaged in limited environmental actions. By the
end of the curriculum, students had a significant increase in their
understanding of climate change and the majority of students reported
they were now engaged in actions to limit their personal impact on
climate change. These findings suggest that believing a scientific
theory (e.g. climate change) is not sufficient for critical science
agency; rather, conceptual understandings and understandings of personal
actions impact students’ choices. We recommend that future climate
change curriculum focus on supporting students’ development of critical
science agency by addressing common student misconceptions and by
focusing on how students’ actions can have significant impacts on the
environment.

## 77.1 abstract

Games are increasingly proposed as an innovative way to convey
scientific insights on the climate-economic system to students,
non-experts, and the wider public. Yet, it is not clear if games can
meet such expectations. We present quantitative evidence on the
effectiveness of a simulation game for communicating and teaching
international climate politics. We use a sample of over 200 students
from Germany playing the simulation game KEEP COOL. We combine pre- and
postgame surveys on climate politics with data on individual in-game
decisions. Our key findings are that gaming increases the sense of
personal responsibility, the confidence in politics for climate change
mitigation, and makes more optimistic about international cooperation in
climate politics. Furthermore, players that do cooperate less in the
game become more optimistic about international cooperation but less
confident about politics. These results are relevant for the design of
future games, showing that effective climate games do not require
climate-friendly in-game behavior as a winning condition. We conclude
that simulation games can facilitate experiential learning about the
difficulties of international climate politics and thereby complement
both conventional communication and teaching methods.

ABSTRACT: Climate change is a highly charged topic that some adults
prefer to ignore. If the same holds true for secondary students,
teachers could be challenged to teach about climate change. We
structured one activity about the biological concepts of carbon cycle
and carbon sequestration in two ways: with and without mention of
climate change. Results suggested that students (n = 22) who learned
about carbon in the context of climate change made significant
improvements in their knowledge of the carbon cycle and sequestration
over those (n = 24) who learned about carbon without mention of climate
change. Interest in climate change may increase learning. © 2016 Taylor

The United Nations Children’s Fund 2008 report, Our Climate, Our
Children, Our Responsibility, warned that children will suffer most from
the effects of climate change. Environmental education is one way to
prepare children to cope and enable them to educate their families and
friends about the need to act now to minimise the danger climate change
poses. This article reports on findings from a participatory action
research project aimed at integrating education for sustainable
development into the Grade 7 curriculum, with a specific focus on
climate change. Critical participatory action research has a
transformative intent, engaging participants in learning to cultivate a
sense of purpose and increase their capacity to solve local problems.
Learner responses to qualitative questionnaires and recorded discussions
related to the Do One Thing (DOT) strategy were used to determine
learning about climate change and enable both learners and community
members to identify action for change. Thematic coding was used to
evaluate the effectiveness of the DOT strategy in increasing awareness
of agency and resultant learning. The findings indicate that not only
did the learners gain knowledge about the causes and consequences of
climate change but the potential of the learners and community members
to identify possible actions for change was increased as well. We
provide suggestions as to how teachers can use the DOT strategy as part
of an action research approach to integrating environmental education
for sustainable development in order to raise awareness of local
environmental threats and encourage learners and their families to
behave in a more environmentally friendly way. The explanation of the
research process offered in this article also highlights how
participatory learning activities can help engage learners as active

  to guide action on climate change in their communities.
- The learners were requested to discuss what they had learnt in the
  classroom about climate change with a responsible adult at home (a
  family member or family friend) and ask them to indicate on a paper
  “leaf” (provided by the teacher) one thing they could think of to
  lessen the harmful effects of climate change in their community. The
  learners were to do the same on another leaf. The next day, the

## 81.1 abstract

Social studies learning is expected to integrate environmental
education, in accordance with the objectives of social studies learning
to improve students’ thinking skills, social problem solving skills and
care for the environment In fact, social studies teachers were found to
have not utilized the physical or social environment as a source of
learning, despite various environmental pollutions have often occurred
in Indonesia and resulted in global warming as an indication of climate
change. This research was intended to 1) identify materials of
environmental pollution around students as a source of social studies
learning; 2) integrate environmental pollution materials in social
studies learning to anticipate climate change; 3) determine the
effectiveness of learning activities on the integration of environmental
pollution materials to anticipate climate change. This research was
classified as quantitative and qualitative research (Mix Method). Data
were collected by means of interviews, observations, documentations and
questionnaires. The results of the research showed that 1) materials of
environmental pollution around students as a source of social studies
learning consisted of water and air pollution that have an impact on
global warming, thus resulting in climate change; 2) environmental
pollution materials were integrated into social studies learning by
reviewing core competencies and basic competencies as outlined in the
lesson plan (RPP) and student worksheets (LKS) with a score of 83%
(valid); 3) Learning activities on environmental pollution materials had
been running more effectively, because of the integration of pollution
cases in the surrounding environment to anticipate climate change. This
was indicated by the significant difference in the results of the
pretest and posttest tests of 0.025 © 2022, Pegem Egitim ve Ogretim

## 82.1 abstract

Ecocentric education programs should include a method for the in-depth
understanding of multi-scale ecological time concepts. To accomplish
this, the common restriction that ecocentric education should pertain
only to realistic nature may have to be removed. The purpose of this
research was to confirm the validity of a program featuring phenology
observation, employing fixed-point time-lapse images as climate change
learning, and to obtain suggestions on the influence of the program on
the multi-timescale concepts of the learners. An observation sheet
listing images of cherry flowering from 16 April to 15 March each year
from 1996 to 2017 was created, and the 50-min educational program using
the observation sheet was conducted with 189 third year junior high
school students. The tendencies among students’ answers to the two
questions before and after the program suggest that the program
contributed to the students acquiring the hundreds-year timescale
concept based on the short-term timescale concept of dynamic nature. The
contribution of this research is to visualize long-term and multi-scale
ecological time concepts. By combining long-term time-lapse images with
everyday nature experiences, the possibility of expanding such emotions
as wonder and attachment to nature towards a long-term ecological
timescale is achieved.

Using the observation sheet printed on an A3-size paper, the students
attached a red sticker on the day they judged as “full bloom date,”
according to the above-mentioned observation criteria (Figure 3). This
observation work took approximately 15 min out of the 50 min allotted
for the entire program. Students were able to grasp the annual change of
flowering phenology by perceiving the red seal similar to a graph point.
At the time, only these 50 min could be secured; thus, the students
themselves did not analyze or consider the relationship between the full
bloom date and the annual temperature. Instead, the instructor explained
that the full bloom date of cherry blossoms was related to global
warming in that it is affected by the temperature conditions of each
year.

The incorporation of informal science modules with traditional
ecological knowledge (TEK) engages students in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. During the summers
2012–2015, Iḷisaġvik Tribal College, located in Barrow, AK, hosted an
average of 12 rural Alaska Native middle-school and high school students
per year in the college’s summer STEM program called “Climate and
Permafrost Changes on the North Slope: In Cultural Context.” Teaching
the carbon cycle as a core concept, this 2-week STEM program examined
climate change and its effects on the local landscape from a multitude
of perspectives. Elders shared their observations and experiences
associated with climate change. Local and visiting scientists gave
presentations and taught through games, hands-on laboratory simulations,
and practical field work—all relevant to the camp’s science content.
Pre-assessments and post-assessments using the Student Assessment of
Learning Gains measured student interests and conceptual understanding.
Students developed and enhanced their understanding of science concepts
and, at the end of the camp, could articulate the impact of climactic
changes on their local environment. © 2017, AESS.

## 84.1 abstract

Anthropogenic climate change caused by the release of excessive
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere is the biggest
challenge of the 21st century. Man-made climate change threatens the
biosphere on which all forms of life depend. Climate change requires
human effort to manage the impact of extreme events such as droughts,
flooding, and heatwaves. As such, human decision-making processes are
crucial for the successful management of climate change impacts. The
decision-making process include awareness and perception of climate
change risks. Awareness and perceptions of (natural) hazard risk are
determinants of human response (adaptation) to environmental shocks
(climate change and variability). To this end, this study explores the
effects of an environmental education course on the awareness and
perception of climate change risks among seventh and eighth grade
learners in South Africa. This exploratory study collected primary data
through the implementation of emergent participation tools in focus
group discussions with learners (n = 23). These emergent participation
tools are the Problem tree and the Hazard, Impact and Vulnerability
matrix. Responses from a comparison group were juxtaposed with those of
environmental education beneficiaries through a qualitative content
analysis technique. Findings reveal that environmental awareness has an
effect on perceptions of current and future climate change risks.
Learners are concerned about short-term risks more than long-term risks.
Short-term risks such as meeting basic needs and dealing with
criminality are priorities over long-term risks such as climate change.
A daily struggle to meet these basic needs represent the local context
and discourse within which learners view and experience their world.
Learners do perceive the causal linkages between different climatic and
non-climatic risks. Drawing such causal linkages raises awareness and
perception and this cause-effect relationship is necessary for
behavioural change. Environmental education is necessary to raise the
awareness and perceptions of learners to environmental risks such as
climate change. More studies are required to explore the topic of
environmental education on raising awareness and perceptions of
environmental risks such as climate change with head of households.

## 85.1 abstract

This study seeks to address critical gaps in climate change education
research with regard to (1) emotions triggered in teenage students
learning about climate change, (2) the students’ complexity thinking
competence in the context of climate change consequences, and (3) the
interconnections between different types of emotions and the levels of
complexity thinking competence in teenagers’ explanations of climate
change. The study drew on quantitative and qualitative data from 315
(2013-2015) and 246 (2021) teenage secondary school students from a
pre-/post-intervention survey from Austria’s year-long
k.i.d.Z.21-Competent into the Future program, in which almost 3,500
students aged between 13 and 19 have participated up to now. Climate
change triggered expected types of emotions in students. Following
exploratory factor analyses, these were clustered into two groups.
Multilevel modeling revealed that the k.i.d.Z.21-modules had no
influence on teenage students’ levels of complexity thinking competence
in their explanations of climate change for themselves and humanity in
general. The first group of emotions (i.e., angry, sad, helpless,
insecure, worried and inspired to act) was associated with higher levels
of complexity thinking competence in participants’ answers to questions
about climate change and, therefore, designated “stimulation”. The
opposite was true for the second group (i.e., apathetic, annoyed, and
hopeful), which diminished the level of complexity thinking competence
in responses and, therefore, designated “attenuation”. Future studies
are encouraged to draw on the emotion measures developed for this study
to replicate and advance this study’s findings. Educationists are urged
to pay greater attention to emotions in climate change education.

## 86.1 abstract

Much energy and money is dedicated to increasing climate change
awareness and pro-environmental behaviors. Mere communication campaigns,
which are often alarmist, are widely used despite their uncertain
effectiveness. We suggest that using binding communication strategies
would prove more adequate. Binding communication consists in combining a
persuasive message and a preparatory act linked to the persuasive
message. This procedure is generally reported to be more efficient than
a single persuasive message at influencing attitudes and behavior. This
hypothesis was tested in a study in which students were presented with a
classic climate change communication with/without a preparatory act
(participant-proposed solutions). Results showed that although knowledge
about climate change increased in both conditions, attitudes and
behavior follow-through were positively affected only in the binding
communication condition. Therefore, in addressing climate change and
global warming behaviors, pairing a persuasive message with personal
solution generation is a potentially valid and useful technique.

## 87.1 abstract

This research explored the characteristics of students’ activities and
their artifacts during their participation in climate change club
projects and investigated the impacts of the club project participation
on students’ ecological citizenship. Climate change club projects were
developed to help students understand climate change, investigate
climate change issues, and plan and participate in social actions.
Participants developed scientific models of causes of climate change and
were expected to develop the own perspectives about socio-scientific
issues related to climate change. Five types of competences of
ecological citizenship were targeted through club activities: knowledge
and understanding, responsibility, justice, sustainability, and
participation. Researchers found activities were student centered and
interactive and artifacts generated by students were resources for
social action. Climate change club activities demonstrated the potential
for student participation in club projects to promote competence for
mitigating climate change among future generations by fostering a new
form of citizenship: ecological citizenship.

## 88.1 abstract

The science-education cooperative venture “Our Common Future:
‘eKidZ’-Teach Your Parents Well” explores intergenerational learning
processes and the transfer of learning from the younger to the older
generation. Students acting as multipliers and their multiplication
effect on parents is part of the research setting: 20 high school
students, in the role of researchers, investigated the question of
whether children who participate in the Climate Change Education (CCE)
program “k.i.d.Z.21” passed on their climate-change-related knowledge,
attitudes and actions to their parents (n= 91), in comparison to a
control group (n= 87). Due to the annual increase in student
participants in the CCE project “k.i.d.Z.21” since 2012 (n= 2000), this
article can build on the results of a questionnaire regarding the school
year 2017/18 (n= 100-120). A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
showed that the “k.i.d.Z.21” project has a multi-faceted knock-on effect
on parents, constituting a multiplier effect: increasing knowledge, and,
above all, improvements to the child-parent relationship. Additionally,
measurable positive effects in the frequency and quality of climate
change communication between children and their parents have been
observed (Spearman Rank Correlations), but a distinct lack of positive
effects regarding changing climate-friendly attitudes or actions have
been noted (Pearson Product-Moment Correlation). The importance of the
child-parent relationship is a key factor in bridging the
knowledge-action gap, and is reviewed in the context of CCE.

## 89.1 abstract

Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) is being used for educational virtual
field trips (VFTs) involving scenarios that may be too difficult,
dangerous or expensive to experience in real life. We implemented an
immersive VFT within the investigation phase of an inquiry-based
learning (IBL) climate change intervention. Students investigated the
consequences of climate change by virtually traveling to Greenland and
exploring albedo and greenhouse effects first hand. A total of 102
seventh and eighth grade students were randomly assigned to one of two
instructional conditions: (1) narrated pretraining followed by IVR
exploration or (2) the same narrated training material integrated within
the IVR exploration. Students in both conditions showed significant
increases in declarative knowledge, self-efficacy, interest, STEM
intentions, outcome expectations and intentions to change behavior from
the pre- to post-assessment. However, there was a significant difference
between conditions favoring the pretraining group on a transfer test
consisting of an oral presentation to a fictitious UN panel. The
findings suggest that educators can choose to present important
prerequisite learning content before or during a VFT. However, adding
pretraining may lead to better transfer test performance, presumably
because it helps reduce cognitive load while learning in IVR.

## 90.1 abstract

Students from three different British Columbia grade six classes were
followed through two weeks of instruction on climate change. Pre, post,
and follow-up surveys were used to determine the differences in
knowledge gained and retained by students that received direct
instruction from their science teacher, and by those who received
equivalent content instruction from outside presenters. The teacher
participant also completed a survey on her experience with the
researcher-designed lesson plans. Students’ results on the surveys were
compared to results from a control group with no intervention. The
teacher-based setting resulted in significantly higher knowledge gain,
although no difference was found between the groups’ rate of knowledge
decline thereafter. Highest gains in knowledge were for the carbon cycle
and the human impacts topic, followed by understanding the difference
between climate and weather. The students and teacher alike appeared to
struggle with the topic of global warming and the greenhouse effect. The
research suggests that with the appropriate background information the
classroom teacher is likely to be more effective at conveying the
science of climate change, particularly when it is taught through an
understanding of the carbon cycle and its human impacts. It also
suggests that those non-governmental organizations engaged in climate
change education might be better served by investing their limited
resources in the development of learning materials and subsequent
professional development for teachers rather than focusing on in-school
presentations.

## 91.1 abstract

A socio-constructivist and experiential process for climate change
education was experimented within two coastal communities of Eastern
Canada with 39 students 13 and 14 years of age. The pedagogical process,
based on local observation of climate change, Duit’s conceptual change
theory (1999) and experiential learning, aimed for the improvement of
students’ conceptions of climate change: the nature of the phenomenon,
its signs, causes, consequences and remedial actions as well as the
possibility of mobilizing the population in reducing its impact on
climate. Initial and final interviews with the young adolescents
indicated an improvement in students’ ideas about climate change’s
diverse dimensions. However, the students expressed their uncertainty
regarding the adults’ ability to change their behaviour. Students also
identified educational activities that helped improve their conceptions.

## 92.1 abstract

During a training program on climate change education, teachers were
invited to experiment with environmental behaviors in their personal
lives. They then created their own climate change education model, with
which they experimented in their classroom. Through teachers’ and
students’ work, individual interviews, and questionnaires, researchers
monitored the behavioral change process of 25 teachers and of 75
students who participated in the pedagogical activities planned by the
teachers. Motivational factors included a profound attachment to the
natural environment and a desire to help the Earth. Facilitating factors
included participation in a support group, the simplicity of chosen
actions, and encouragement from family members. Limiting factors
included time, the lack of awareness in one’s surroundings,
forgetfulness, and fatigue. The theory put forward by Prochaska,
Norcross, and DiClemente (2002) was used to interpret the results and
propose pedagogical interventions in climate change education. © Taylor

## 93.1 abstract

The authors invited teachers participating in a climate change education
course to voluntarily demonstrate new environmental behaviors. They were
interviewed and described the process of change they experienced.
Facilitating professional development activities were participation in a
community of change, construction of knowledge of climate change, a solo
activity in nature, and a continuum of values. Organizational skills,
personal advantages, and ease of chosen actions were facilitating
factors. Limiting factors included lack of time and lack of awareness of
people around them and the difficulty of affirming one’s differences.
Participants experienced positive feelings in their process, except for
guilt when they forgot to do the new actions. © 2006 Heldref

reusable containers in lunchboxes (2 participants of 3). Aspects
facilitating behavioral change were mainly two: being part of a
community had reinforced the idea that individual behaviors can truly
make a difference, even if the actions are minimal. Second, having heard
people in their group talk of actions they were already accomplishing
incited them to imitate those people.

## 94.1 abstract

This study investigated the effects of two differently designed
classroom scripts that guided the teacher-led interventions during the
courses of the WISE Climate Change project. 168 students from 10 classes
were randomly assigned to either the high-structured condition (teacher
interventions on group level and on class level) or the low-structured
condition (only teacher interventions on group level). Effects were
measured on students’ knowledge integration and students’ need
satisfaction. The results did not provide evidence that the
high-structured condition leads to higher learning gains, yet it was
found that pausing the group work during computer-supported
collaborative learning (CSCL) to provide structure and feedback by the
teacher at a whole-classroom plenary level significantly lowered the
feelings of competence frustration. Especially low prior knowledge
students expressed higher competence frustration in the low-structured
condition. These findings suggest to blend CSCL with teacher-led class
interventions to optimize the learning environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier

## 95.1 abstract

Climate change is a complex environmental problem that can be used to
examine students’ understanding, gained through classroom communication,
of climate change and its interactions. The present study examines a
series of four science sessions given to a group of primary school
student teachers (n = 20). This includes analysis of the communication
styles used and the students’ pre- and post-conceptualisation of climate
change based on results obtained via essay writing and drawings. The
essays and drawings concerned the students’ unprompted pre- and
post-conceptions about climate change, collected before and after each
of the four inquiry-based science sessions (in physics, chemistry,
biology and geography). Concept mapping was used in the analysis of the
students’ responses. The communication used in the four sessions was
analysed with a communicative approach in order to find out the
discussion about climate change between teacher and students. The
analyses indicated that the students did not have the knowledge or the
courage to participate in discussion, but post-conceptualisation map
showed that students’ thinking had become more coherent after the four
sessions. Given the results of the present study, proposals for using
concepts maps and/or communication analysis in studying students’
conceptions are presented.

## 96.1 abstract

Students everyday ideas of the greenhouse effect are difficult to
change. Environmental education faces the challenge of developing
instructional settings that foster students conceptual understanding
concept of the greenhouse effect in order to understand global warming.
To facilitate students conceptual development with regard to the
greenhouse effect, learning materials aimed at promoting active
cognitive learning in order to achieve deep understanding were designed.
The learning materials were developed on the basis of the theory of
reasoning and understanding co-founded by the Swiss educational
psychologist Aebli. In a repeated measure design using a pre-, post- and
follow-up test, the efficacy of these learning materials compared with
standard learning materials was tested. A total of 289 eighth graders
who had received little prior science instruction participated in the
study. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to
examine the students knowledge acquisition and understanding over three
measurement times. The group that had been instructed according to the
method aimed at in-depth learning outperformed the group taught with
standard materials on subsequent tests in terms of knowledge gains,
structure and retention. The findings suggest that the theory-based
learning materials promote active cognitive processing during learning.
The instructional design of the learning materials seems to engage the
learners in high cognitive activities that facilitate deep conceptual
understanding of the complex and abstract concept of the greenhouse
effect. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

## 97.1 abstract

To support self-regulated learning (SRL), computer-based learning
environments (CBLEs) are often designed to be open-ended and
multidimensional. These systems incorporate diverse features that allow
students to enact and reveal their SRL strategies via the choices they
make. However, research shows that students’ use of such features is
limited; students often neglect SRL-supportive tools in CBLEs. In this
study, we examined middle school students’ feature use and strategy
development over time using a teachable agent system called Betty’s
Brain. Students learned about climate change and thermoregulation in two
units spanning several weeks. Learning was assessed using a
pretest-posttest design, and students’ interactions with the system were
logged. Results indicated that use of SRL-supportive tools was
positively correlated with learning outcomes. However, promising
strategy patterns weakened over time due to shallow strategy
development, which also negatively impacted the efficacy of the system.
Although students seemed to acquire one beneficial strategy, they did so
at the cost of other beneficial strategies. Understanding this
phenomenon may be a key avenue for future research on SRI-supportive
CBLEs. We consider two hypotheses for explaining and perhaps reducing
shallow strategy development: a student-centered hypothesis related to
“gaming the system,” and a design-centered hypothesis regarding how
students are scaffolded via the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

## 98.1 abstract

Research related to teaching climate change, system thinking, current
reform in science education, and the research on reform-oriented
assessment indicate that we need to explore student understanding in
greater detail instead of only testing for an incremental gain in
disciplinary knowledge. Using open-ended items we assessed details in
student successes and challenges in thinking about climate change and
climate system. Twelve teachers of the 7th and 8th grades and 457
students from four schools in a Midwestern state participated in this
study. Statistical analysis of student responses on the pre- and
post-test showed a significant (p\<0.0001) gain in knowledge but more
importantly, qualitative analysis of student responses showed that they
learned that our climate is changing but had constructed a linear
connection between variables such as surface temperature and drought.
The students did not develop a connected body of knowledge or an
understanding of climate as a system. Future research needs to focus on
curriculum development, effective system pedagogy, assessment, and
teacher development in the context of climate change as an interlinked
system.

## 99.1 abstract

The objective of this study was to develop a prototype of environmental
education teacher through PAIC process. Sample group was selected by
purposive sampling technique based on the defined criteria. The
methodology was implemented with
Participatory-Appreciation-lnfluence-Control (PAIC) integrated with
brain-storming and focus group discussion for developing trainer (TOT)
to be a prototype. The research results illustrated that after PAIC
process implemented, the mean scores of posttest of knowledge of
Environmental Education (EE), knowledge of global warming,
characteristics of Environmental Education Teacher (EET), inspiration of
environmental conservation, environmental behavior, and training
achievement were higher than pretest with statistical significance
(p\<.01, p\<.01, p\<.01, p\<.01, p\<.01, and p\<.01) respectively.
Furthermore, FDE was used for trainer role play evaluation, it
illustrated that Trainer Self-Evaluation, Audience Evaluation, Trainer
Friend-Evaluation and Expert Trainer-Evaluation were no differences
among four dimensional aspects of evaluation, then the 10 selected
scientific teachers with top ten highest scores to be trainers. One-way
ANOVA was used investigate the mean scores difference of four groups.
The results of One-way ANOVA showed that there were difference of mean
scores on role play as trainer in training process (p\>.05). The 10
trained scientific teachers would be prototype of EET trainers and the

## 100.1 abstract

The aim of this mixed research is to analyze the students’ perception
about the use of the collaborative wall in the educational process of
global climate change considering data science. The collaborative wall
is a web application that allows the active participation of students
and discussion of ideas in the classroom. During the face-to-face
sessions, the students use mobile devices to share the information and
images of the courses through the collaborative wall. The sample is made
up of 74 students from the National Preparatory School No. 7 “Ezequiel
A. Chávez” who took the Biology IV course during the 2019 school year.
The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that the
organization of ideas and dissemination of information in the
collaborative wall positively influence the learning process of global
climate change, motivation and interest of the students. Data science
identifies 6 predictive models about the use of the collaborative wall
in the field of Biology through the decision tree technique. In fact,
the use of the collaborative wall in the Biology IV course facilitated
the assimilation of knowledge about the global climate change and
improved the active participation of the students in the classroom.
Finally, the collaborative wall allows the creation of new educational
spaces where students acquire the main role during the learning process.

## 101.1 abstract

The process of learning science in some schools is still in the form of
direct transfer from teacher to student. The learning process will be
meaningful if the students involved and explore more in building a
concept. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of
Argument-Driven Inquiry on students’ concept in learning global warming.
The method that is used in this research was quasi-experiment. The study
used two classes with one experimental group that used Argument-Driven
Inquiry and one control group that used Inquiry-based Learning. The
population of this study is seventh-grade students in one of Secondary
School in Bandung, Indonesia. The sample is chosen by purposive sampling
technique. The participants consist of 52 students from the experimental
group and the control group. Each group consists of 26 students. The
result of this study shows the improvement of students’ concept mastery
in the experimental group is obtained as 0.45 and for the control group
is 0.28. Based on the result, Argument-Driven Inquiry gives the better
impact in improving students’ concept mastery. Argument-Driven Inquiry
can be considered as one of the teaching models that can be implemented
in Junior Secondary School. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing

Using the ‘future workshop’ (FW) method, adolescents can be prepared for
responding to climate-related risks at the local level. The
‘KLAR!–Zukunftswerkstatt’ presents a case study combining climate change
information, FW and place-attachment theories. Its development and
application with 41 learners in one upper-secondary school in Austria
are demonstrated. Statistically significant findings suggest that
students are more aware about mitigation and adaptation behaviors after
participating in FW. Qualitative findings demonstrate that students
developed higher levels of action knowledge for mitigation and
adaptation behaviors. Such teaching approach is not limited to the
researched case, but supports environmental education in general. © 2020

researchers and students. - Critique phase (200 min): students were
invited to investigate current and projected climate-related risks in
regional human and natural systems using material from the Austrian
Assessment Report Climate Change 2014 (APCC, 2014) and other sources. -
Fantasy phase (200 min): students developed their own ideas, a theorized
future in which carbon emissions are reduced and adaptation to
climate-related risks is enhanced - Implementation phase (200 min):
participants identified meaningful climate solutions for their home
region and they discussed their personal roles for increased climate
action - Follow-up phase(200 min): final sham event in which students
presented their outcomes to their school and community

## 104.1 abstract

Climate change is a complex topic and hence makes teaching climate
change a demanding task. This is especially because climate change still
represents a (socially) controversial topic and students may be
confronted with misrepresentations and misinformation about climate
change in their daily lives. Therefore, it is important that science
teachers are equipped with skills to properly respond to or “debunk”
climate change misinformation, and to train their students on how to
identify and respond to misinformation. To address this, we developed an
intervention based on inoculation theory and known debunking techniques
to foster physics pre-service teachers’ debunking skills as well as
their self-efficacy to confront climate misinformation. Through the
intervention, we showed that the participants increased their debunking
skills and they showed more accurate assessments of their own skills. We
conclude that this approach is promising to foster pre-service teachers’
perceived competence to teach the demanding topic of climate change.
Finally, our approach generally shows potential in preparing future
teachers to teach other controversial topics where misinformation is
abundant.

## 105.1 abstract

Nine 11th and 12th grade students from a large urban high school
participated in a three-tiered program that charged them with the
responsibility to be earth science mentors for 7th graders from a local
feeder school. During Tier I, a three-month training period, these 11th
and 12th graders worked closely with university-based scientists,
science educators, and secondary science teachers to learn a tested
curriculum on climate change and to prepare to be mentors. Prior to Tier
I, four scientists involved in climate change research were asked to
derive independently a list of concepts that they perceived to be most
central to this topic. A concept mapping exercise was developed from
their consensus and, both at the beginning and at the end of Tier I,
student understandings were analyzed with concept maps and interviews. A
baseline of 11th and 12th grade students’ understandings of climate
change is established and suggestions are made as to how these findings
can inform instructional practices in the geosciences.

During Tier I, nine 11th and 12th grade students were split into four
groups of two-to-three students each. During a one-week intensive summer
workshop, each group was assigned to a certain aspect of climate change
and then collaborated with the other groups to help them understand
their topic. After the workshop, members of a university-based team
consisting of university scientists and science educators, and secondary
science teachers, continued to scaffold the 11th and 12th grade students
on a weekly basis over the course of two months to help them prepare for
Tier II an Tier III. During Tier II, the 11th and 12th grade students
visited a feeder middle school approximately three times a week for five
weeks where they facilitated a unit on climate change for 7th grade
middle school students. During Tier III, the 11th and 12th grade student
mentors worked with the 7th grade students to prepare and present a
traveling exhibit to other 7th grade students. Both the 7th and 11th and
12th grade students continued to be supported by the university-based
team throughout Tier II and Tier III.

Although informal learning environments have been studied extensively,
ours is one of the first studies to quantitatively assess the impact of
learning in botanical gardens on students’ cognitive achievement. We
observed a group of 10th graders participating in a one-day educational
intervention on climate change implemented in a botanical garden. The
students completed multiple-choice questionnaires in a
pre-post-retention test design. Comparing the test scores revealed a
significant short-term knowledge gain as well as a long-term knowledge
gain. Consequently, our results show the potentials of botanical gardens
as effective learning environments, and for complementing formal
school-based learning settings regarding climate change education.

## 107.1 abstract

Besides cognitive learning effects, short-term environmental education
(EE) is often regarded as ineffective in intervening with participants’
environmental attitudes and behaviour. However, in Germany, school
classes often participate in such 1-day EE programmes because they
better match the school curriculum in contrast to longer (residential)
programmes. We therefore monitored a 1-day outreach EE programme on
global climate change to reveal whether environmental attitudes and/or
connectedness with nature of tenth graders are affected. Students from
German high schools (college preparatory secondary school level,
‘Gymnasium’) (N0114) from age 14 to 19 participated in the programme
(treatment group). It consisted of two student-centred learning units on
the topic of climate change. Additionally, we chose a control group of
students who did not participate in the programme. To measure students’
environmental attitudes and connectedness with nature, we administered
the Two Major Environmental Values (2-MEV) and the Inclusion of Nature
in Self scale in a pre-, post- and retention test design. The pre-test
was administered 1 week before, the post-test directly after and the
retention test 4 to 6 weeks after programme participation. Analyses
revealed a positive long-term effect only for utilitarian values (one of
the two major environmental factors of 2-MEV) which decreased
significantly. Therefore, depending on the programme’s content,
short-term EE programmes indeed may have an influence on participants’
environmental attitudes. © Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada,
Lisboa, Portugal and Springer Science+Business Media BV 2012.

## 108.1 abstract

When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various
conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools
to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often
prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed
to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students’
concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude
qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the
approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions
before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For
the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied.
A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From
strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we
assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely
time-consuming handling, the authors’ approach is suitable for
application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to
inform teachers about students’ conceptions.

## 109.1 abstract

In this work, we present the design, implementation, and initial
outcomes of the Climate Academy, a hybrid professional development
program delivered through a combination of face-to-face and online
interactions, intended to prepare formal and informal science teachers
(grades 5–16) in teaching about climate change. The Climate Academy was
designed around core elements of successful environmental professional
development programs and aligned with practices advocated in benchmarked
science standards. Data were collected from multiple sources including
observations of professional development events, participants’
reflections on their learning, and collection of instructional units
designed during the Academy. Data were also collected from a focal case
study teacher in a middle school setting. Case study data included
classroom observations, teacher interviews, and student beliefs toward
climate change. Results indicated that the Climate Academy fostered
increased learning among participants of both climate science content
and pedagogical strategies for teaching about climate change.
Additionally, results indicated that participants applied their new
learning in the design of climate change instructional units. Finally,
results from the case study indicated positive impacts on student
beliefs and greater awareness about climate change. Results have
implications for the design of professional development programs on
climate change, a topic included for the first time in national
standards. © 2016, The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.

## 110.1 abstract

Transitioning food, energy and water systems for adaptation and
mitigation of climate change is a challenge requiring social as well as
technological solutions. The best technological solutions will only be
effective if combined with behavior changes placing climate change at
the forefront of our socio-cultural consciousness. Education is central
in creating such a shift. Climate researchers have an important role in
aiding the uptake of climate change education in U.S. public schools,
where educators are often untrained and uncomfortable teaching the
subject. This paper assesses the efficacy of implementing an
interdisciplinary, experiential climate change curriculum in school
garden classrooms in terms of student climate literacy and teacher
professional development. The questions of how to teach and research
climate education are explored via a participatory research project with
schools in Oakland, CA and Lopez Island, WA. Initial results show
improvement in student learning and engagement as well as teacher
preparation. Both qualitative and quantitative data are analyzed through
student surveys, teacher interviews, and site observation; however,
further qualitative methodologies to study process of climate and energy
literacy development are needed. Specifically, this paper argues for new
forms of assessment to capture dimensions of climate literacy including
knowledge, engagement, and behavior change.

## 111.1 abstract

Abstract The results of the application of a pedagogical proposal, based
on the guiding principles of liberating pedagogy, are presented, through
the offer of a semester course (“Yes, in Ceará there is this!”) with
content on earthquakes and climate change for students from a full-time
public school located in an area of social vulnerability (HDI 0.395) in
Fortaleza, Ceará. The results showed that the adoption of this
pedagogical practice provides, in addition to the dissemination of
theoretical and scientific knowledge, awareness to develop future
actions aimed at mitigating the risks and effects of natural disasters
triggered by possible changes in the climate and by the occurrence of
earthquakes in the communities. Thus, the cooperative teaching-learning
process provided the appropriation of knowledge about earthquakes and
climate change, being able to provoke among the participating students
actions and ideas aimed at sensitizing the community about the effects
of anthropogenic climate changes, enabling the training people aware of
their role in the community in which they live.

## 112.1 abstract

We designed and pilot tested “You and CO2”, a program designed to
encourage students to reflect on their personal impact on the
environment, while also appreciating their place within society to bring
about positive societal change. Over three interlinked workshops,
students analysed the carbon footprints of some everyday activities,
which they then explored in more detail through interacting with a
bespoke piece of interactive digital narrative (IDN), No World 4
Tomorrow. Previous papers have discussed the feasibility of the program
and student engagement with the concepts. This paper presents analysis
of the playthrough data as each participant in the program played the
IDN to completion, examining trends in story selection choices for how
they reflect students’ understandings and attitudes towards climate
change and their own ability to make a difference in matters large and
small pertaining to climate change.

## 113.1 abstract

We explored how computer games developed as part of an innovative set of
climate change education materials helped students learn and gain
interest in global climate change (GCC) science by making it personally
relevant and understandable. This research was conducted in a public
school district in the southeastern United States. The curriculum,
Climate Change Narrative Game Education (CHANGE), used a local,
place-based approach using scientific data gathered from the Gulf of
Mexico coast and incorporated (a) computer games, (b) a scientifically
web-based science fiction novel about future Gulf coast residents, and
(c) hands-on laboratory activities. This paper focuses on how the
computer games affected students’ learning, validity of their beliefs
about GCC, and understanding of the effects of GCC on the region’s sea
level and storms. The data collected included students’ exam scores, and
surveys about student perceptions of climate change science and
perceptions of the materials. On exam questions related to GCC science,
students who participated in the CHANGE curriculum scored significantly
higher than their peers who did not. Also, their beliefs about GCC
increased in validity. The nature and design of the computer games had a
strong impact on students’ understanding of sea level rise and storms. ©

From Discussion: “The general pattern was that the students, whether
honors or regular, scored significantly higher on the exams in the full
usage group, than in the no usage group, however students with moderate
or minimal usage of CHANGE materials did not score significantly higher
than no usage”

However, in the Results: $$honor students$$ “Post hoc comparisons using
the (Least significant Difference) LSD test indicated that the mean
scores for the most usage condition (M = 53.0, SD = 17.02), moderate
usage condition (M = 51.7, SD = 17.66), and less usage condition (M =
52.8, SD = 19.18) were significantly higher than for the no usage
condition (M = 46.31, SD = 16.56). Partial eta squared was .025, for a
medium effect size. However, there were no statistically significant
differences between the three groups (the most, moderate, and less usage
conditions)” $$non-honor students$$ “Post hoc comparisons using the LSD
test indicated that the mean scores for the moderate usage condition (M

## 114.1 abstract

Young people around the world show considerable engagement with climate
change. How can education draw on this engagement in order to benefit
students and society? In this article, we discuss how inquiry-based
dialogues can support students’ development in their societal
engagement. We argue that such dialogues should include real-world
problems involving disagreement, which promote students’ agency. We
elaborate on qualities of dialogues, such as developing argumentation
and perspectives together through respect, attentive listening and
recognition of others’ viewpoints. Central theoretical perspectives
include inquiry-based dialogues and students’ lived democracy. This
research draws on data from a classroom activity where 15-16-year-old
students in Norway investigate controversial issues related to
electrifying offshore oil platforms. The students are in a learning
situation, and the teacher wants them to learn about climate change and
the oil industry and the skills and attitudes needed to participate in
inquiry-based dialogues. The dialogues show that students bring
knowledge, opinions and attitudes from outside school, characteristics
that are crucial for students’ engagement. We discuss how teachers can
facilitate students’ further engagement by addressing multiple aims of
inquiry-based dialogues.

## 115.1 abstract

The tensions between environmental protection and economic growth are
critical to future well-being, and it is therefore important to
understand how young people conceptualize these tensions. The aim of the
present study is to explore students’ solutions to the dilemma of
economic development and mitigating climate change, with regard to
societal responses to the challenge of climate change. The study was
conducted in China’s Green Schools. Green School is an international
long-term programme with the aim of increasing students’ knowledge of
environmental issues, and transferring this knowledge into positive
actions to affect the wider community. The data were obtained through
semi-structured pre- and post-interviews with 15-16-year-old students in
three groups (12 students) from Green Schools in the Beijing area. The
results show that students’ discussions focused exclusively on economic
growth and social welfare. Students seem to believe that environmental
problems are inevitable, nature is a ‘box’ of resources, and economic
development is necessary in order to sustain and even improve nature.
Therefore, there is no dilemma between economic development and
environmental protection. The paper ends with a discussion on research
and implications for teaching climate change.

## 116.1 abstract

Research on adolescent climate change perceptions has uncovered key
insights about how knowledge, concern, and hope might relate to behavior
and the potential for educational interventions to influence these
factors. However, few of these studies have employed treatment/control
designs that might address causality and none have addressed how these
factors might interact to influence behavior. We developed a model of
behavior change where a climate education treatment impacted knowledge,
knowledge impacted hope and concern, and hope and concern together
impacted behavior. We empirically tested the utility of this model and
the causal relationships within it using a pre/post, treatment/control
evaluation of climate education among adolescents in North Carolina, USA
(n=1041). We found support for a causal relationship between the
treatment and gains in knowledge, but not between treatment and
behavior. However, we did find support for a path model in which climate
change knowledge positively relates to increased climate change concern
and hope, and increases in concern and hope predict changes in
pro-environmental behavior. Low SES was related to smaller gains in
knowledge, concern, and behavior. Our results contribute to a
theoretical understanding of climate change behaviors among adolescents
and suggest that climate education aiming to change behavior should
focus on building hope and concern.

## 117.1 abstract

Climate communication research suggests strategic message framing may
help build public consensus on climate change causes, risks and
solutions. However, few have investigated how framing applies to
adolescents. Similarly, little research has focused on agricultural
audiences, who are among the most vulnerable to and least accepting of
climate change. Among 950 high school agriculture students in North
Carolina, we found agriculture and environment framing of climate
change, but not community and health frames, elicited feelings of worry,
and these together with community frames elicited hope. Further,
students feeling more worry were more supportive of individual and
collective action. Those accepting climate change and females had more
emotive responses and higher support for all action measures, and
acceptance of human causes predicted more worry and support for
collective action. We find these results encouraging as agriculture
teachers likely employ agriculture and environment frames when following
best teaching practices.

- on average, students felt intermediate levels of hope (2.42 out of 5,

- We identified a mediating relationship where agricultural or
  environmental framing predicted the emotion of worry, which in turn
  predicted intended individual behaviour and support for collective
  action
- We found no difference in hopefulness between those students who read
  the environment or community frames compared with those who read the
  agriculture frames
- We also found partial support for our hypothesis that students who
  felt more worry and hope after reading the climate change news article
  would be more likely to report intended individual behaviour and
  support for collective action Uncontrolled variable:
- Females were more worried and hopeful than males, as well as more
  likely to support adaptation and mitigation measures and report
  intended individual climate-friendly actions
- the more likely students were to report that they thought global
  warming was happening, the more likely they were to report feelings of
  worry and hope, as well as support for adaptation, mit igation, and
  individual climate-friendly behaviours
- Republicans were less likely than Independents or those politically
  unaffiliated students to support mitigation actions.
- We found that those accepting of human causes had similar responses to
  framing as reflected in the overall summary statistics, with
  environment and community frames associated with a more hopeful
  response than health frames (Figure 3). However, among those sceptical
  of human causes, the agriculture frame was associated with greater
  levels of hopefulness than environment and health frames (Figure 3).

## 118.1 abstract

The study aims to investigate the effects of an online learning model,
Read-Answer-Discuss-Explain-Create (RADEC), on the emergence of creative
ideas and projects for 7th-grade students when designing local solutions
to global warming problems. Case studies were used in this research by
implementing learning in environmental science concepts. This one-shot
case study research was conducted on 30 7th-grade students (16 boys and
14 girls) selected through the purposive sampling technique. The
research was conducted in Bandung, Indonesia. Five stages are carried
out in the RADEC learning model, including the Read-Answer stage, where
students answered pre-learning questions outside the classroom; the
Discuss-Explain stage, where students responded to their pre-learning
questions in small and large groups; and the Create stage, where
students agreed on solutions to a problem and realised the product of a
creative project. Qualitative data were collected through worksheets,
posters, and guided interviews. Although students have not been able to
demonstrate originality thinking skills, the implementation of the
online RADEC model stimulated students’ fluency and flexibility thinking
skills. This was evident from the many creative ideas or projects of
students. Besides, students could decide on ideas or group projects to
solve global warming problems with rational considerations. Although the
online RADEC model has not been able to produce original creative
products, its implementation has stimulated students to think creatively
about solving global warming problems. In addition, the implications,
limitations, advantages and potential of further research are discussed
in this paper. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2022.

## 119.1 abstract

This article’s focus was on transitioning middle grade students from the
position of having a positive environmental attitude toward their
exhibiting actual behaviors that address climate change. Using research
by Newhouse’s criteria of changing attitude into behavior, specific
activities were developed and tested in a eighth grade classroom. The 5E
model of instruction was the strategy used to build the series of
activities. Thus, we began the class with a series of engaging questions
for discussion to differentiate between attitudes and behaviors.
Building a knowledge base about the negative outcomes of climate change
as well as new technologies that exist to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions were the initial explorations and strategies used to move
students from attitude to behavior. The groups’ development and
implementation of classroom presentations where they learn about
negative climate change outcomes and the technologies available to
address these outcomes were described. Discerning what was accurate
Internet information and post presentation discussions were some of the
review strategies used for explanation to occur. The two foundation
building presentation activities were followed by two behavior-based
activities (i.e., extension/elaboration) for the purpose of moving
students from positive attitudes to positive behaviors with regard to
addressing climate change.

## 120.1 abstract

Problem-based learning (PBL) and inquiry learning (IL) employ extensive
scaffolding that results in cognitive load reduction and allows students
to learn in complex domains. Hybrid teacher professional development
models (PDM) using 21st century social collaboration tools embedding PBL
and IL shows promise as a systemic approach for increasing teacher
content knowledge of climate science and ubiquitous social media
technology skills. This paper describes workshops designed to increase
the climate pedagogical content knowledge (CPCK) of upper elementary and
secondary teachers while providing initial and on-going scaffolding for
successful implementation of PBL projects involving collaborative
research on local, regional and global climate topics. Exemplars of
participation by the K-12 students in the citizen scientist component of
the “From Learning to Research” project (L2R) are described, including
illustrations of recognition by local and global community members
regarding students’ contributions to reducing anthropomorphic impact on
local ecosystems.

This article presents a project, Shapes of Water, funded by the Finnish
Cultural Foundation, which gave music education students the opportunity
to compose children’s songs about climate change with the help of
artists from two fields (contemporary circus and music) and a scientist
(chemistry). The article outlines the ways in which the composing
project challenged students’ attitudes toward composing as a method for
educating children about climate change, and brings together the
experiences of the artists and scientist during the project. Finally,
three focus areas are presented with recommendations for a sustainable
eco-socially oriented approach to music education.

The starting point for the composing project was Shapes of Water, a
contemporary circus work that took place in early 2022. The work talked
about the changing states of water in northern surroundings through
circus, contemporary dance, light and video photography, and projection.
Shapes of Water described the relationship between human and water
states through two dancing and mutually supportive bodies, stories, and
images. The work was created by the circus and dance artist couple
Katariina and Jared Van Earle, Kat&Jared. After their performance at the
beginning of this composing project, Kat&Jared held a workshop for both
groups (major and minor) to inspire students to discuss the feelings and
ideas their performance evoked. Collaboration with Kat&Jared and Soiva
Siili enabled ways to expand the effectiveness of contemporary circus
work and share the artistic processes of professional artists with music
education students. Students, in turn, composed children’s songs about
climate change in workshops (40 hr for major students, 20 hr for minor
students). The workshops included, for example: (a) introduction to and
execution of the group composing method of Soiva Siili, (b) development
of awareness in taking inspiration from other art forms and the
environment, and (c) independent composing work in small groups (four to
six students). After 3 months’ work, the results of the composing
project were performed in two concerts at the University of Oulu. The
concerts were named after one new song: “Holding on to Tomorrow With
Both Hands.” The original idea was to target the concerts to 11- to
12-year-old 6 children, but other age groups and other university
students and staff were also invited. The concerts lasted for 1 hr and
included 10 songs relating to climate change (five by major students,
five by minor students). Kat&Jared choreographed three songs and also
performed in the concerts. Accordingly, Soiva Siili and Professor
Pursiainen had their own roles in the concerts. Most of the songs2 and
their sheet music were sent to the schools that participated in the
concerts so that the teachers could use the songs in their teaching. In
addition, the students had an opportunity to record their songs in a
studio if they wanted.

Art as a game changer was notable. All the students were aware of
climate change, but the composing project strengthened their
understanding about the power of music in making a difference in daily
educational practices. Composing itself was seen as a good way to
educate children for a more sustainable way of living. The students also
reflected on the impact of climate change on their own pedagogical
thinking. They realized that their role as future music educators is to
educate their pupils to act toward a better future in and through music.
They also realized how their own musical activities through composing
can serve as a pedagogical tool in tackling difficult and sometimes very
emotional and even frightening themes. In many answers, awareness of
climate change seemed to turn students’ gaze to the future and to the
solutions that could promote a more sustainable lifestyle in school.

## 122.1 abstract

To prepare students to make informed decisions and gain coherent
understanding about global climate change, we tested and refined a
middle school inquiry unit that featured interactive visualizations.
Based on evidence from student pre-test responses, we increased emphasis
on energy transfer and transformation. The first iteration improved
comprehension of the visualizations resulting in better understanding of
energy transfer (n = 67). The second iteration improved understanding of
energy transformation (n = 109) by adding pivotal cases, reducing
deceptive clarity, and emphasizing distinguishing of ideas. Focusing
student investigations in the second version allowed students to make
more normative, personally relevant decisions related to their energy
use. These iterative refinements reflected knowledge integration
principles and offer guidance for designers of inquiry units. © 2012

Recent research suggests that the issue of global warming is one of
great concern for Australian children. This point to the need for
effective teaching about this issue. Children should be properly
informed about actions that help reduce carbon emissions as this may
give them a sense of empowerment and go some way to alleviating
concerns. This study followed the development in the knowledge of global
warming of 29 primary school students in year 6 (the final year of
primary) from two regional Australian schools over one school term. A
hands-on science unit dealing specifically with global warming was
prepared and taught over a period of eight weeks. A mixed methods
approach was adopted and data was gathered through pre- and
post-testing, through post intervention interviews. The findings of the
study indicated that after the unit, students had a clearer
understanding of the science of climate change, with the largest
improvement in student knowledge occurring where the students had
engaged in hands on activities or had effective visual aids. The data
also indicated that an increase in knowledge was accompanied by an
increase in levels concern in some cases. However, there was also an
overall increase in students’ belief about their ability to make a
positive impact in relation to global warming and climate change.

## 124.1 abstract

Involvement in climate change has been proven to be hindered by
emotional and social barriers, as well as by conceptual difficulties
that students may encounter in dealing with scientific content related
to particular issues such as the greenhouse effect. In this study, we
start from the conjecture that behind many conceptual difficulties and
emotional barriers lie particular epistemological obstacles related to a
naive and stereotypical view of science. These include, in particular,
the belief that science still has the role and power to provide a
unique, unquestionable, and certain explanation of events and processes.
Such a naive idea clashes strongly with the intrinsic complexity of
climate science. This paper sets out to investigate if and how the
improvement of epistemological knowledge can influence behavioural
habits and foster students’ engagement in climate change. In order to
explore such an issue, we focus on five interviews collected at the end
of a teaching experience on climate change, carried out with secondary
school students (grade 11; 16-year olds). This study is a follow-up of
other two analytical studies aimed at investigating, respectively, the
impact of the experience on students’ epistemological knowledge and on
their behavioural habits.

different attitudes toward the activities. Student 6 (S6) represents a
“shy” person in the class, he actively took part in the lab activities
but he was not pro-active in the collective discussions; student 13
(S13) represents the “excellent” student of the class, he was much

student 16 (S16) represents the “sceptic” attitude toward climate
change, he was not interested in the issue and demonstrated mistrust
toward the activities; student 25 (S25) represents the “outsider” of the
class, he was not particularly interested in the activities in general
and also in the climate change issue; finally, student 26 (S26)
represents the “thoughtful” attitude toward knowledge, he was very

They were very at ease during the interviews and could express
themselves comfortably. From those 3 students: the epistemological

significant. We correlations can be found between the epistemological
and behavioural dimensions and that the teaching path was able to
create, for some students, a virtuous dynamic state among them.
$$These$$ three cases concern students who had an initial distrust or
resistance toward climate change issues and found personal new reasons
for engagement in the epistemological perspective of complexity. 2. S13
("the excellent") and S6 ("the shy"). They were quite embarassed during
the interviews and did not enjoy so much, nor improved so much in
relation to the epistomological new way to present science.The other two
students acted as contrastive cases and allowed us to see some boundary
conditions needed to trigger personal involvement. These conditions
regard the need to master disciplinary knowledge in order to recognize
the value of the epistemological and social dimensions and the
importance of feeling free from the teacher’s expectations before being
able to explore and find one’s own position with respect to such complex
issues.

## 125.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the significant global challenges currently
facing humanity. Even though its seriousness seems to be common
knowledge among the public, the reaction of individuals to it has been
slow and uncertain. Many studies assert that simply knowing about
climate change is not enough to generate people’s behavioural response.
They claim, indeed, that in some cases scientific literacy can even
obstruct behavioural response instead. However, recent surveys show a
rather poor understanding of climate dynamics and argue that lack of
knowledge about causal relationships within climate dynamics can hinder
behavioural response, since the individual is not able to understand
his/her role as causal agent and therefore doesn’t know how to take
proper action. This study starts from the hypothesis that scientific
knowledge focused on clarifying climate dynamics can make people
understand not only dynamics themselves, but also their interactive
relationship with the environment. Teaching materials on climate change
based on such considerations were designed and implemented in a course
for secondary-school students with the aim of investigating whether this
kind of knowledge had an influence on students’ willingness to adopt
pro-environmental behaviours. Questionnaires were delivered for testing
the effect of the teaching experience on knowledge and behaviour.

## 126.1 abstract

Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate a case in which various
extracurricular activities were implemented to promote high school
students’ climate-friendly actions. Research Methods: This study’s case
was the Green Team Student Club, in which 18 high school students
engaged voluntarily in different types of extracurricular activities
during student club hours throughout two school semesters. Data were
collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews, observations, and
document analysis of the student tasks. Findings: Findings revealed that
the students explicitly displayed climate-friendly behaviours such as
developing strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of their school,
becoming conscious energy and water consumers, and informing other
people about climate change while they developed action competence
through knowledge-construction (attending interactive seminars, field
visits, etc.), dissemination of knowledge (preparing posters, writing
articles for the school journal, etc.), and experiencing action
(calculating the carbon footprint of the school and developing
strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of the school, etc.).
Implications for Research and Practice: While the results may provide
insights for teachers and school principals about integrating
extracurricular activities within the schooling process, policymakers
can also use them in planning to create climate-friendly educational
settings. (C) 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved

## 127.1 abstract

This study examined the role of a future-oriented scenario with
secondary school students using diorama construction which included
climate-change knowledge and envisioning alternative futures. To explore
the potential role of futures-thinking modelling, students from one
class participated in a 12-week cross-curricular inquiry with their
teachers. Jensen’s (2002) dimensions of action-oriented knowledge are
used to examine the climate-change knowledge developed by the students.
Four common images of the future (Dator, 2014) are incorporated as
models to forecast alternative futures. The findings suggest the value
of future-oriented dioramas for developing climate-change understanding
and futures thinking.

## 128.1 abstract

This paper documents a collaborative, multi-site participatory action
research project in collaboration with children to act on climate change
within local community settings. The project was an after-school program
that combined hands-on climate change educational activities with
photovoice, a participatory action research method that uses digital
photography as the basis for problem identification, group dialogue, and
social change action. Grounded in transformative sustainability learning
theory and integrated with an arts-based participatory action research
methodology, the program was designed to strengthen children’s climate
change awareness and sense of agency through youth-led action projects.
After describing the program, this article details the collaborative
action projects designed and carried out by 10- to 12-year-olds in each
community (e.g., policy advocacy, tree-planting, community garden) as
well as how the program facilitated children’s constructive climate
change engagement through children’s enjoyment and agentic action. The
critical importance of participatory process and collaborative action in
strengthening children’s sense of agency is discussed.

The first four activities (i.e., introducing ecosystems, climate
vs. weather, and and collaborative action) were action-focused.
Activities were freely available online and compiled for their alignment
with program format (e.g., target age, length) and goals (e.g.,
children’s enjoyment, action). Weather-permitting, several activities
took place outdoors, and some activities mirrored common children’s
games (e.g., energy bingo; greenhouse gas tag)climate change). In SCA,
photovoice methodology served to bridge educational program content with
youth-led action through art (Q. Wang et al., 2017). Specifically,
children were given digital cameras to capture and express their
personal connections with program topics. During monthly photovoice
discussions, participants, in small groups, told stories of their
photographs’ content and meaning. Following photovoice sessions,
children translated their collective commitments and visions into action
plans. SCA’s action component included: (1) the development of “family
action plans” to promote small-scale, everyday sustainable behaviors
(e.g., reducing energy use and waste) and (2) the design and
implementation of “community action projects,” through which children
were supported in realizing their visions for a collaborative project to
advance sustainability in the wider community.

Throughout SCA, children’s sustained sense of enthusiasm for the program
seemed to coexist alongside their growing climate change awareness and
motivation for action. A key contributor to children’s enjoyment of the
SCA program — and which undergirds its transformative, arts-based, and
participatory dimensions — was the interactive (i.e., hands-on,
experiential, action-oriented) nature of program activities. Children
enjoyed playing an active role throughout the program, rather than being
passive recipients of knowledge or mere “implementers” of pre-determined
forms of action. In this study, learning about climate change
strengthened children’s motivation for action, and their participation
in youth-led action projects empowered their sense of agency (see Figure
2). In this sense, a second critical dimension of children’s
constructive climate change engagement was agentic action. In
particular, children’s sense of agency was supported by the “adult-like”
responsibilities undertaken during their collaborative action projects.

## 129.1 abstract

This manuscript explores the possibilities and challenges of art-science
integration in facilitating collaborative sustainability action in local
settings. To date, much sustainability education is prescriptive, rather
than participatory, and most integrated art-science programming aims for
content learning, rather than societal change. What this means is that
learners are more often taught “what is” than invited to imagine “what
if?” In order to envision and enact sustainable alternatives, there is a
need for methods that allow community members, especially young people,
to critically engage with the present, imagine a better future, and
collaboratively act for sustainability today. This manuscript introduces
a methodological framework that integrates the arts and sciences to
facilitate: (1) transdisciplinary learning, focusing on local
sustainability challenges; (2) participatory process, bringing
experience-based knowledge into conversation with research-based
knowledge; and (3) collaborative sustainability action, inviting
community members to envision and enact sustainable alternatives where
they live. The transformative potential of this framework is examined
through international case studies from countries representing the
richest and poorest in the Western hemisphere: a multi-site research
study and after-school program for climate change education and action
in collaboration with children in the Western US; and a multi-cycle
research study and community arts center course for environmental
photography and youth-led water advocacy in Southern Haiti. Despite many
shared characteristics, case studies diverge in important ways relative
to the sustainability challenges they sought to address, the specific
context in which activities took place, and the manner in which
art-science integration was practiced. Across cases, however,
art-science integration facilitated participants’ learning, connection,
and action for sustainability. Framed by the shared aims of
transdisciplinary approaches, this manuscript discusses methodological
hurdles and practical lessons learned in art-science integration across
settings as well as the transformative capacity of alternative
pedagogical and research practices in building a sustainable future.

## 130.1 abstract

This mixed-methods study examined how ten- to twelve-year-old children
experienced and made sense of their growing climate change awareness
through an after-school program that used participatory methods to
facilitate children?s informed climate change action. The fifteen-week
program combined hands-on educational activities with digital
photography and culminated in youth-led action projects focused on
individual (i.e. daily habits) and collaborative change (i.e. community
projects). After the program, children knew significantly more about the
scientific and social dimensions of climate change than before, and more
than the average U.S. teen or adult. Survey and focus group analyses
showed that, in addition to learning, children were inspired and
motivated by their growing climate change awareness. Children felt
empowered by their knowledge and eager to learn more and take action to
minimize harms. Towards theorizing children?s constructive climate
change engagement, the importance of informal learning environments for
children?s intergenerational and political influence is discussed.

## 131.1 abstract

Scientists and sustainability scholars continue to make urgent calls for
rapid societal transformation to sustainability. Science education is a
key venue for this transformation. In this manuscript, we argue that by
positioning children as critical actors for sustainability in science
education contexts, they may begin to reimagine what science means to
them and to society. This multi-site, mixed-methods study examined how
children’s climate change learning and action influenced their science
engagement along cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. For
fifteen weeks, ten- to twelve-year-olds participated in an after-school
program that combined on-site interactive educational activities (e.g.,
greenhouse gas tag) with off-site digital photography (i.e., photovoice
process), and culminated in youth-led climate action in family and
community settings. Participants were 55 children (M= 11.1 years), the
majority from groups underrepresented in science (52.7% girls; 43.6%
youth of color; 61.8% low-income). Combined survey and focus group
analyses showed that, after the program, science became more relevant to
children’s lives, and their attitudes towards science (i.e., in school,
careers, and in society) improved significantly. Children explained that
understanding the scientific and social dimensions of climate change
expanded their views of science: Who does it, how, and why-that it is
more than scientists inside laboratories. Perhaps most notably, the
urgency of climate change solutions made science more interesting and
important to children, and many reported greater confidence,
participation, and achievement in school science. The vast majority of
the children (88.5%) reported that the program helped them to like
science more, and following the program, more than half (52.7%) aspired
to a STEM career. Lastly, more than a third (37%) reported improved
grades in school science, which many attributed to their program
participation. Towards strengthening children’s science engagement, the
importance of climate change learning and action-particularly
place-based, participatory, and action-focused pedagogies-are discussed.

## 132.1 abstract

In response to growing recognition for the mental health impacts of
climate change, understanding the full range of children’s psychological
experiences in climate change education (CCE) contexts is critical to
developing approaches that support children’s constructive engagement
and overall well-being. Through surveys and focus groups conducted with
fifty-five children (ages 10-12), this mixed-methods study examined the
affective and attitudinal impacts of a multi-site CCE program that
encouraged children’s learning, reflection, and action. Findings suggest
that, through the program, children acquired stronger pro-environmental
attitudes, a deeper respect for nature, and a greater sense of urgency
towards the need for climate action. Importantly, children’s negative
emotions (e.g. fear, worry, anger, sadness) were mitigated by positive
emotions grounded in youth-led climate action in family and community
contexts. Findings are interpreted through theories of cognitive and
affective transformation, which shed light on the beneficial micro- and
macrolevel outcomes of children’s perspective shifts.

Program activities took place for one hour per week across three
research sites. Based on the ‘Head, Hands, and Heart’ model of
Transformative Sustainability Learning (Sipos, Battisti, and Grimm
2008), activities consisted of three major program components: (1)
Science: hands-on CCE activities intended to make visible and concrete
the often invisible and abstract connections between Earth’s atmosphere,
local ecosystems, and the actions of people within their communities
(‘Head’); (2) Camera: digital photography according to the photovoice
ethod (Wang and Burris 1997), whereby children took and discussed
photographs representing their feelings about and connections with
program activities (‘Heart’); and (3) Action: youth-led action projects
inspired by their photography in both family and community settings
(‘Hands’). Family action plans, created and carried out by each
participant, consisted of everyday climate-relevant behavior changes.
Community action projects, collaboratively designed and implemented by
children at each research site (e.g. tree-planting; city council
presentation; community garden), focused on awareness-raising and action
at a neighborhood scale.

Overall, children felt greater urgency after the program (M = 4.07, SD =
0.62), compared to before (M = 3.81, SD = 0.65). During post-program
focus groups, children were asked how their perspectives on climate
change shifted as a result of their program participation. Children
attributed to their SCA participation an increased sense of respect for
nature, feelings of intensified urgency about the need for climate
action, and a mixture of positive and negative feelings about climate
change rooted in their concerns and motivations to address the issue
through their own actions. Findings of the present study build on
previous articles in this series to show a range of positive impacts on
children who, through their program participation, gained awareness,
shifted their climate-relevant attitudes, and acquired a sense of agency
while working together on youth-led action projects to address climate
change in their communities (see also Trott 2019; 2020; Trott and
Weinberg 2020). There was evidence that children’s feelings of concern
were offset by positive emotions grounded in taking action on climate
change.

## 133.1 abstract

This article reflects on collaborative research undertaken in Dawkins
Park Reserve, NSW, Australia. The aim of the collaboration was to
develop a local Indigenous cultural and educational outdoor precinct.
Participants involved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and
non-Indigenous teachers and primary (Year 6) and secondary (Year 7)
school students from three government schools and one catholic school.
Fostering student knowledge of, and stewardship about, the reserve’s
ecological biodiversity specific to climate change effects over time was
the desired outcome. In this article, we share the successes and key
challenges of using this park as a case study for outdoor learning as a
case study for outdoor learning about climate change in an authentic,
localised setting, and the contributions of Indigenous cultural and
scientific knowledge to the development of the students’ understanding.
Questionnaires and focus group discussions were undertaken with 174
students, while seven teachers engaged in focus group discussions.
Quantitative data supported the significant increase in learning
enjoyment outside the classroom and improved understanding of climate
change at a local level. Conversely, departmental policy and COVID were
identified as constraints for regular off-campus learning.

## 134.1 abstract

In this work, we examine middle school students’ understanding of the
greenhouse effect and global warming. We designed and refined a
technology-enhanced curriculum module called Global Warming: Virtual
Earth. In the module activities, students conduct virtual experiments
with a visualization of the greenhouse effect. They analyze data and
draw conclusions about how individual variables effect changes in the
Earth’s temperature. They also carry out inquiry activities to make
connections between scientific processes, the socio-scientific issues,
and ideas presented in the media. Results show that participating in the
unit increases students’ understanding of the science. We discuss how
students integrate their ideas about global climate change as a result
of using virtual experiments that allow them to explore meaningful
complexities of the climate system.

To examine the impact of naming rights on support for environmental
protection, we provided a high school class the opportunity to name a
species of a parasitoid wasp after hearing a lecture on the extent and
loss of biodiversity, with special focus on species description and
climate change. Two other classes received the same presentation but
were not able to name the species. Results showed a small impact on
behavior, when controlling for environmental identity, with the
experimental group scoring higher than the other two groups. This effect
did not persist at a retest 4 months later. Other analyses showed,
however, that environmental concern and concern about effects on the
ecosystem had a significant effect on behavior at time 2 even when
controlling for behavior at time 1. Implications for educational
interventions are discussed. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

## 136.1 abstract

This article presents a STEAM project, “Sustainable City”, based on
educational robotics whose objective is to bring the problems of climate
change closer to primary school students. The participants were 30
students (aged 10–11) from 5th year of Primary Education and the project
consisted of 14 sessions in which different active methodologies such as
project-based learning, collaborative learning and the flipped classroom
were carried out. A pre-test and a post-test were carried out and the
results were better in the post-test, which indicates that the students
improved their skills and increased their motivation. As a conclusion,
this STEAM project, which is adapted to the Spanish LOMCE curriculum,
can be a reference for other teachers to bring their students closer to
the problem of environmental change through educational robotics and the
use of active methodologies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI,

Developing solutions for complex issues such as global climate change
requires an understanding of the mechanisms involved. This study reports
on the impact of a technology-enhanced unit designed to improve
understanding of global climate change, its mechanisms, and their
relationship to everyday energy use. Global Climate Change, implemented
in the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE), engages sixth-grade
students in conducting virtual investigations using NetLogo models to
foster an understanding of core mechanisms including the greenhouse
effect. Students then test how the greenhouse effect is enhanced by
everyday energy use. This study draws on three data sources: (1) pre-
and post-unit interviews, (2) analysis of embedded assessments following
virtual investigations, and (3) contrasting cases of two students
(normative vs. non-normative understanding of the greenhouse effect).
Results show the value of using virtual investigations for teaching the
mechanisms associated with global climate change. Interviews document
that students hold a wide range of ideas about the mechanisms driving
global climate change. Investigations with models help students use
evidence-based reasoning to distinguish their ideas. Results show that
understanding the greenhouse effect offers a foundation for building
connections between everyday energy use and increases in global
temperature. An impediment to establishing coherent understanding was
the persistence of an alternative conception about ozone as an
explanation for climate change. These findings illustrate the need for
regular revision of curriculum based on classroom trials. We discuss key
design features of models and instructional revisions that can transform
the teaching and learning of global climate change.

## 138.1 abstract

When engaging with socioscientific issues, learners act at the
intersection of scientific, school, and other societal communities,
drawing on knowledge, practices, and identities from both in and out of
the classroom to address problems as national or global citizens. We
present three case studies of high school students whose classroom
participation in a unit on the politically polarizing topic of climate
change was informed by their political identities and how they situated
themselves in climate change’s sociocultural, historical, and geologic
context. We describe how these students, including two who initially
rejected human-influenced climate change but revised their
understandings, negotiating dissonant identities in the classroom
through repeated engagement with conflicting political and scientific
values, knowledge, and beliefs. These case studies problematize building
bridges between formal and informal learning experiences and suggest
that it may be necessary to leverage disconnections in addition to
building connections across settings to promote productive identity
work. The results further suggest that supporting climate change
learning includes attending to identity construction across ecosocial
timescales, including geologic time.

Results are difficult to synthetise (detailed analyses of the 3 cases
over 42 pages, with quite a different objective from ours), however the
main ideas are: - Luke (republican with a climate denier father) had to
negotiate the conflict between the curriculum’s scientific content and
the political beliefs of his family, but change his views about climate
change and integrate knowledge about it - Timothy (republican) was also
very critical about the reality of anthropogenic climate change. His
personal identity as someone who was good at science helped support his
engagement with the evidence. This continuity of this valued practice
across settings ultimately supported Timothy in negotiating tensions
between the communities to which he belonged and his continuing science
identity work. Timothy participated a lot in the debate, integrated a
lot of the scientific processes and knowledge and changed radically its
view toward anthropogenic climate change - Gareth (democrats with
eco-concerned parents) thought that he did not need to be convinced
because of its democrat background. He did not participate very actively
in discussions, and ended up more or less sure of the mechanisms of
climate change, his statements demonstrate that his understanding of
climate change was a dynamic one influenced both by the science he
learned as well as by the controversy that he was exposed to through
social interactions in the classroom. However, he deepened his
understanding of both the scientific and political dimensions, and as a
result he wanted to continue to learn more about thescientific evidence
and the social controversy While actions and intents were not central in
the analyses, the authors noted that the 3 students were not very eager
in taking actions against climate change, for various reasons

## 139.1 abstract

The Green Ninja Film Academy (GENIE) is an interdisciplinary curriculum
development project that examines the efficacy of combining climate
science concepts and practices with digital storytelling for middle
school youth. We present findings from iterative enactments of this
design-based research project in 2017 (N = 296) and 2018 (N = 539). On
average, youth increased scores on assessments of science content and
practices while demonstrating competencies in filmmaking and science
explanations. Further, an inverse correlation was seen between initial
identification with the environment and change in environmental
identification throughout the unit. Results suggest that integration of
creative filmmaking into a climate science curriculum aligned to the
Next Generation Science Standards can increase engagement and science
proficiency particularly for youth who initially show less engagement in
environmental science.

climate science and interest in and perceptions of agency related to
climate action, and interviews to examine the impact of the GENIE
intervention. The GENIE curriculum combines Next Generation Science
Standards-aligned climate science lessons with storytelling and
filmmaking and is designed to be completed in 4–8 weeks depending on the
teacher and classroom schedule. The curriculum begins with a video that
issues a challenge to students to learn about climate change and
communicate what they find out to their communities via a film in order
to help address the changes and impacts they discover. The second
section of the curriculum focuses on storytelling and filmmaking,
beginning with a Story Spine, a scaffold to aid in writing a good story.
Students use the Story Spine to break down a well-known folktale
(e.g. The Three Little Pigs) and then use the Story Spine to write their
own stories.

## 140.1 abstract

Emotion has been recognized as a significant factor affecting climate
engagement behavior. However, empirical experiments testing emotions
influencing behavioral changes, climate change education (CCE) in
particular, are rare. In this study, we conducted a 2-week CCE program
with the support of video clips to induce emotions such as fear and/or
hope through the manipulated treatments and were then compared between
emotion plus lecture group and lecture-only group for adolescents to
explore how emotions affect self-reported mitigation behavior toward
climate change. The study involved 1730 students from nine middle
schools in three coastal cities (Xiamen, Shenzhen, and Ningbo) in China.
The results demonstrated that emotional video clips were the successful
stimulus for target emotions. There was a significant improvement in
both knowledge-gaining and self-reported mitigation behavior in the
lecture-only group, and climate change concern and involvement mediated
the effect on mitigation behavior. Compared to the lecture-only group,
the hope treatment group showed decreased knowledge gain but no
significant effect on self-reported mitigation behavior. In contrast,
emotion significantly reduced students’ self-reported mitigation
behavior in the fear treatment group, which was mostly pinpointed to the
behavioral change of emission reduction activities. Thus, the study
highlighted the importance of knowledge with appropriate emotions in
adolescents to safeguard educational outcomes.

## 141.1 abstract

The establishment of the Next Generation Science Standards brought
climate science into standards-based education. However, teachers face
challenges implementing these standards, including a lack of resources
and textbooks, which may not accurately describe climate science or the
forces driving those changes. A climate science workshop was conducted
to give teachers an agriculturally based climate change curriculum.
Using agriculture as the context for teaching about climate change
provided teachers with opportunities to tie local, real-world climate
change examples to their students’ lives. Teachers attending the
workshop expressed similar opinions to the general population ranging
from climate change denial to alarm before receiving the training.
Teachers’ opinions relating to climate science changed following the
presentation of climate science presented as an integrated component of
modern agronomic production. Teachers appreciated receiving facts and
being allowed to decide for themselves about the severity of the
changing climate. Contrary to what teachers reported anticipating,
communities considered skeptical of climate change claims were accepting
of an agriculturally based curriculum presenting climate change and
adaptation as scientific facts void of political agendas. © 2022 The

## 142.1 abstract

It is a concern that children represent an under-researched group in
flood education and preparedness because as adults they are more likely
to experience flooding as the climate changes, and because it suggests
their potential today, as agents of change, is being undervalued. Using
action-based, participatory methodology with seven to nine-year-old
children, a creative and inclusive flood education resource was
developed as a stimulus for learning. Evaluation revealed that young
children can learn about flooding and preparedness, and that
intergenerational learning from child to parent can also occur, with
children transferring the messages learned in school to home. However,
thematic analysis suggests key factors such as family relationships
(empowerment of children) and the parents’ disconnection and
dissociation from risk limit the success of intergenerational learning.
The implications of these in relation to flood education, flood
preparedness, and household resilience levels are explored.

## 143.1 abstract

A majority of secondary science teachers are found to include the topic
of climate change in their courses. However, teachers informally and
sporadically discuss climate change and students rarely understand the
underlying scientific concepts. The project team developed an innovative
pedagogical approach, in which teachers and students learn climate
change concepts by analyzing National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) global data collected through satellites and by
imitating the NASA data collection process through NASA Airborne Earth
Research Observation Kites And Tethered Systems (AEROKATS), a kite-borne
remote sensing system. Besides AEROKATS, other major components of this
system include a web-collection of NASA and remote sensing data and
related educational resources, project-based learning for teacher
professional development, teacher and student field trips, iOS devices,
smart field data collector apps, portable weather stations, probeware,
and a virtual teacher collaboratory supported with a GIS-enabled mapping
portal. Three sets of research instruments, the NASA Long-Term
Experience-Educator End of Event Survey, the Teacher End of Project
Survey, and the pre-and-post-Investigating Climate Change and Remote
Sensing (ICCARS) project student exams, are adapted to study the
pedagogical impacts of the NASA AEROKATS remote sensing system. These
findings confirm that climate change education is more effective when
both teachers and students actively participate in authentic scientific
inquiry by collecting and analyzing remote sensing data, developing
hypotheses, designing experiments, sharing findings, and discussing
results.

Background: Children’s flood risk perceptions that include their
awareness and behaviors, can be cultivated through disaster education,
which is crucial for improving disaster resilience and adaptation to
climate extremes. However, education’s co-influencing effect along with
family and society was unclear. This study investigated a three-year
disaster education program conducted in schools in Sichuan Province,
China.

Our results implied that the disaster education including classroom

effect on children’s flood risk perceptions and, comparatively,
classroom education had the most significant effect. School is not only
a haven to protect children from risks, but also could provide an
effective platform for the transfer of the information, knowledge and
skills that can increase their awareness and teach behaviors to cope
with these disaster risks (Olowokere and Okanlawon, 2014; Powell and
Holleran-Steiker, 2017; Christiansen et al., 2018). internet had a

## 145.1 abstract

A lot of today’s world vices can be eliminated if certain targeted
modules and adapted curricula are introduced in the schooling system.
One of these vices is energy squandering with all its negative
consequences for the planet (e.g. depletion of finite energy sources and
the subsequent climate change). This paper describes the results of an
energy-thrift information and education project taking place in
different levels of education in Crete-Greece, which records 321
students’ and their parents’ routine energy-related behavior and proves
that this behavior changes to a more energy efficient one, after the
dissemination of relevant information and the participation into the
energy education projects. Namely, response percentages indicating the
energy-efficient behavior increased after project participation while
the ones indicating an energy-squandering behavior decreased. The
Wilcoxon signed rank test was statistically significant in all energy
behavior questions related to students and to most questions related to
parents. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
