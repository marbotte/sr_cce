**title** Fostering senior primary school students’ understanding of
climate change in an inquiry-based learning environment

## 1.1 abstract

This quasi-experimental study explored the impact of inquiry-based
instruction on students’ conceptions of climate change and their
perceptions of science learning environment. A total of 68 senior
primary school students participated into the study. Data sources
included Questionnaire on Global Climate Change and Constructivist
Learning Environment Survey. Data were coded and analysed using
quantitative procedures. Before the instruction, about 25% of the
participants were aware of the major consequences of, causes of and
possible cures for climate change. Following the instruction, about
50–85% of the participants developed scientific understandings about
climate change, but the participants showed slow progress in terms of
identifying nonscientific conceptions concerning climate change. In
addition, students perceived inquiry-based learning environment more
encouraging compared to their regular science classes. © 2020 ASPE.

## 1.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study intended to explore the impact of inquiry-based instruction
on senior primary school students’ conceptions of climate change and
their perceptions of science learning environment as they experience
such an instruction.

**Questions**:

(RQ1) What are the frequencies of conceptions concerning consequences
of, causes of, and cures for climate change exhibited by senior primary
school students before and after the instruction? (RQ2) In what ways do
senior primary school students’ understanding of climate change differ
from pre to postinstruction? (RQ3) In what ways do senior primary school
students’ perceptions of science learning environment differ from pre to
postinstruction?

## 1.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons and activities

**Description**: 6 lessons, lasting 12 class hours in total. Each lesson
intended to address one aspect of climate change. The entire instruction
was designed utilising the 5E learning cycle, a form of guided inquiry,
and each lesson employed the levels of either structured
(predict-observe-explain) or guided inquiry. There are some hands on
activities - Experience on controlled acidity and seashells
dissolution - Experience on melting ice in water or on rocks -
calculation of personal carbon footprint - discussion about ethics of
science

## 1.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test/post-test

**Analysis**: Questionnaire on global climate change, coded 0 (false),
1(I dont know) and 2 (true) Score are calculated and tested with paired
t-test Effect size are calculated with Cohen’s d

**Results**: RQ1, Consequences of climate change : Following the
instruction, about 75–85% of the participants developed scientific ideas
about the major consequences of climate change, and they were able to
connect the idea of desertification with the climate change (see Table
1). However, the progression in connecting the ideas of flooding and
having more bugs and pests on crops with climate change was not as
dramatic as the other scientific ideas. RQ1, causes of climate change:
Following the instruction, more than 50% of the participants developed
scientific understandings about the major causes of climate change, and
in total, about 75–80% of the participants were sure that the climate
change is caused by the large amount of carbon dioxide released into the
atmosphere. RQ1 cures of climate change: Following the instruction,
70–80% of the participants developed the idea about the frequently
recognised cures for climate change such as planting trees, recycling
paper and rarely using cars for transportation. RQ2 Students
understanding of climate change: A paired samples t-test of the
participants’ pre and postquestionnaire total scores indicated a
statistically significant change toward a scientific understanding of
global climate change (t = −13.779,p \< .01) (see Table 4) The
participant answered also better to questions which were not from the
lessons or related to school programs the authors give this
interpretation: The participants, who provided scientific responses on
the questionnaire, may have either been guessed or learned from other
sources based their individual efforts.

**Improved?**: Better knoeledge and concepts concerning climate change
(consequences, causes, cures)

## 1.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increased right conceptions about climate change after
lessons Better understanding of climate change Note: it does not concern
only the topics of the lesson but also other topics (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 1.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The instructional features, such as involving in
first-hand experiences, making sense of certain phenomena based on
collected evidence and sharing and discussing understandings, and coming
up with common agreement on certain issues on climate change, which
fostered the expansion of conceptions in students’ conceptual framework

**Message to keep:**: Classical example of science club activities on
Climate change. Note: the fact that students learned about the effect of
climate change on crop pest while it was not a topic in the science
club, nor in classes might be worth noting for the synthesis

**title** Mastery experiences in immersive virtual reality promote
pro-environmental waste-sorting behavior

## 2.1 abstract

The rapid digitalization following COVID-19 necessitates best-practice
knowledge on how to use educational technologies such as immersive
virtual reality (IVR). At the same time, to deal with climate change, we
require new ways to embed climate change education in formal education.
The current study is one of the first to investigate the feasibility of
an alternative educational approach to improving waste management in the
classroom as part of formal education, utilizing mastery experiences in
IVR. We explore the use of a novel IVR simulation on waste management,
an example of pro-environmental behavior, for climate change education.
A total of 173 high school students participated in a pre-registered
intervention investigating the impact of IVR on knowledge and intentions
to act pro-environmentally. A 2x2 design was used to compare different
design approaches to the IVR simulation based on the instructional
design elements of the instruction sequence (Direct Instruction
vs. Productive Failure) and feedback (Corrective Feedback
vs. Exaggerated Feedback). The results indicated that IVR was effective
for increasing students’ knowledge (η2 = 0.41), intentions (η2 = 0.10),
self-efficacy (η2 = 0.4), and response efficacy (η2 = 0.35) and that
students found the simulation interesting and enjoyable. Furthermore,
self-efficacy was found to predict intentions (B = 0.190, p = .015),
supporting the idea that cognitive and affective factors drive the
effectiveness of IVR. No significant differences were found in the
effectiveness of the instructional design elements. This suggests that
IVR can be an effective educational technology for learning through
mastery experiences, but that more research on the boundary conditions
of how and when to apply different instructional design elements
effectively is needed. © 2023 The Authors

**title** If You Change Yourself, The World Changes: The Effect of
Exhibition on Preservice Science Teachers’ Views about Global Climate
Change

## 3.1 abstract

Although learning can occur in many environments e. g. science museum or
zoo, some studies reported that teachers are prone to avoid outdoor
activities since they lack of field trip training. For that reason; this
study aims to explore the effect of the exhibition on preservice science
teachers’ views about global climate change (GCC) as well as teaching
drawing technique. The visiting of American National History Museum’s
“Climate Change: The Threat to Life and A New Energy Future” exhibition
allows to see how individual, communal, and governmental actions in
using energy more efficiently, in combination with pursuing promising
new energy alternatives, can make a meaningful impact in reducing GCC.
Data analysis revealed that they have learned drawing technique which is
an effective way to obtain students’ perceptions. Additionally, the
effect of exhibition on preservice teachers’ awareness and knowledge of
GCC showed clearly changing and teachers’ self-confidence have been
increased to use outdoor activities. Moreover, with this field trip
experience let them to transfer their understanding about informal
learning into classroom practice.

**title** The building of knowledge, language, and decision-making about
climate change science: a cross-national program for secondary students

## 4.1 abstract

The United Nations’ declaration on climate change education in December
2014 has sparked a renewal of policies and programs initiated during the
‘Decade of Education for Sustainable Development’ (DESD, 2005-2014),
aimed at promoting awareness, understanding, and civic action for
environmental sustainability within learning communities all around the
world. We present findings from a dialogic, multimodal, and
literacies-based educational project designed to provide secondary
students (N = 141) from four countries with the resources to read about
and discuss evidence regarding climate change from seminal studies with
peers and a core group of scientists (N = 7). Post-program interviews
revealed a significant increase in language use related to
evidence-based reasoning. Students also demonstrated an increased
propensity to recycle. These findings support the hypothesis that
providing opportunities for students to read and discuss seminal
scientific sources incites positive changes in beliefs, attitudes, and
behaviors related to climate change and climate science, and
understandings of the nature of scientific evidence and argumentation.

results of each participant

**Results**: With respect to NOS understanding, at pretest, a total of
35 demonstrations (out of 384 possible; 4 opportunities for each of the
96 students) of NOS understanding were his difference was statistically
significant (x2 = 4.59, df = 1, p \< .05). Qualitatively, participants
appeared to demon- strate an increase in understanding of science as a
continual process of evidence-based reasoning and consensus-building
(e.g. scientists test their ideas again and again; they have a question
and figure out a way to get an answer so that other scientists can see
what they did and judge for themselves if it is correct) and move away
from more politically or ideologically based and less tentative views
about scientific work (climate change is all made-up because it is
getting warmer anyway; scientists keep changing their minds; they
$$scientists$$ give us facts about what is going on).

Climate Change Instructional Module

## 5.1 abstract

We report the results of a climate change module delivered to 48 Grade
3/4 students in Nova Scotia, Canada. We tested for prior knowledge and
evaluated interventional effectiveness using art elicitation. Common
climate change misconceptions were demonstrated in their preintervention
artwork, while postintervention artwork showed improved concordance with
climate change causes and impacts, with little grasp of adaptation or
mitigation. Students and teachers alike responded positively to the
lessons, and few students demonstrated negative emotional reactions to
the material. We highlight some shortcomings, but demonstrate the
utility of art elicitation and the appropriateness of introducing
climate change to Grade 4 students. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis

## 5.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: teaching module containing seven lessons on climate change
topics

**Description**: After the session, Students produced their artwork
using watercolor paint on 8.5 × 11-inch watercolor paper. JB began each
art session by ex- planning to the class that the goal of the activity
was to see what students thought about when they heard the words
“climate change.”\|In response to student requests for clarification,
the classroom instructions were expanded to suggest “causes” or
“results” as possible topics.

## 5.5 Methods/Results

## 5.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: student conceptions of climate change (*Worked?*: yes )

## 5.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Students demonstrated limited knowledge about climate
change before the modules and misconceptions related to littering,
particulate and water pollution, and the ozone layer. By contrast, their
postintervention artwork/artist’s statements included causes (e.g.,
greenhouse gases), a range of projected climate change impacts
(increased rain, wind, erosion, sea level rise, etc.), some mitigation
options, but very little adaptation.

**Message to keep:**: We found art elicitation to be an effective
diagnostic tool and a creative mode of engagement, which provides

**title** Learning about climate change in, with and through art

## 6.1 abstract

Effective strategies to learn about and engage with climate change play
an important role in addressing this challenge. There is a growing
recognition that education needs to change in order to address climate
change, yet the question remains “how?” How does one engage young people
with a topic that is perceived as abstract, distant, and complex, and
which at the same time is contributing to growing feelings of sadness,
hopelessness, and anxiety among them? In this paper, I argue that
although the important contributions that the arts and humanities can
make to this challenge are widely discussed, they remain an untapped or
underutilized potential. I then present a novel framework and
demonstrate its use in schools. Findings from a high school in Portugal
point to the central place that art can play in climate change education
and engagement more general, with avenues for greater depth of learning
and transformative potential. The paper provides guidance for
involvementin,with, andthroughart and makes suggestions to create links
between disciplines to support meaning-making, create new images, and
metaphors and bring in a wider solution space for climate change. Going
beyond the stereotypes of art as communication and mainstream climate
change education, it offers teachers, facilitators, and researchers a
wider portfolio for climate change engagement that makes use of the
multiple potentials of the arts.

**title** Climate education in secondary science: comparison of
model-based and non-model-based investigations of Earth’s climate

## 7.1 abstract

In this mixed method study, we analyse the effectiveness of two
pedagogical approaches - one model-based and another non-model-based -
for developing secondary students’ understanding of the phenomenon of
increase in Earth’s average surface temperatures, a core dimension of
global climate change (GCC). Building on past research on teaching and
learning about Earth’s climate, we use an Evidence-Based Reasoning
framework to assess student tasks and interviews from a 3-week,
project-developed, model-based curriculum. We observed that the use of a
climate model allowed students to reason more effectively about the
Earth’s increasing temperatures. They were able to establish the premise
and interpret evidence for the phenomenon more effectively with the
climate model. Using temperature and carbon dioxide data sets, students
observed and quantified the behaviour of climate variables, establishing
correlation and causation through data-integrated claims. In doing so,
students were able to develop scientific knowledge about climate science
as well as understand the processes undertaken by climate scientists in
analysing climate data. Given the importance of fostering climate
literacy in K-12 students, study findings have implications for both
teaching and learning about GCC using climate models, as well as in
shifting students’ focus from acquiring knowledge to constructing their
own knowledge.

## 7.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

analyse the effectiveness of two pedagogical approaches – one
model-based and another non-model-based – for developing secondary
students’ understanding of the phenomenon of increase in Earth’s average
surface temperatures, a core dimension of global climate change (GCC).

**Questions**:

How do students engage in evidence-based reasoning about the phenomenon
of global increase in average surface temperatures differently in the
context of a non- model-based activity vs a model-based activity? How
does a computational model support students’ reasoning about the phenom-
enon of global increase in average surface temperatures?\|

## 7.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: training

**Description**: Students first complete the non-model-based activity
(day 1, 2, 3) and then proceed to the model-based activity (day 4 and 5)
using EzGCM. For both activities, teachers initiated instruction with a
guiding question, ‘Why does it feel like the weather is getting hotter
each year?’ and encouraged students to use their prior knowledge about
the Earth’s climate, GCC, and the phenomenon of the global increase in
average surface temperatures for making initial claim.

**title** Thinking About Global Warming: Effect of Policy-Related
Documents and Prompts on Learning About Causes of Climate Change

## 8.1 abstract

We examined students’ understanding of the causes of a scientific
phenomenon from a multiple-document-inquiry unit. Students read several
documents that each described causal factors that could be integrated to
address the given writing task of explaining the causes of change in
average global temperature. We manipulated whether the document set
included a document that took a position on climate change policies and
whether a reading/writing prompt focused only on understanding the
causes (“explain how and why recent temperature changes are occurring”)
or also included a solution-related addendum (“and what we can do about
it”). The results suggest that including a policy-related document can
lead to poorer learning outcomes for the causes of climate change, with
evidence that students focused on policy in lieu of, rather than in
relation to, a causal understanding of the issue.

## 8.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

“In this study the main goal of the inquiry task for all students was to
provide an explanation for how and why global temperatures are changing
from a document set that contained several documents, each of which
described different aspects of the phenomenon (e.g., Griffin et al.,
2012; Wiley et al., 2009). Although all students were given the same
core document set, some students also received an additional document
relating to policy changes that could be made to combat climate change.
If the additional policy document is distracting to students or if the
presence of this document changes their task model to that of writing an
opinion essay, then they should focus on this policy information at the
expense of causal information. Therefore, students with this document
should include less causal information in their essays and perform worse
on the inference verification task than those with only the core
document set.” “Given the call for students to read more authentic
science material and the belief that considering solutions or involving
students in policy-related discussions can better engage students’
interest, it is important to demonstrate whether these activities lead
to benefits in understanding.”

**Questions**:

NA

## 8.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Document reading and essay writing

**Description**: —Two class periods spanning 2 days. 1. Students read a
document set. Half of the participants also read a policy editorial. 2.
Students were given an inquiry prompt. Half of the participants received
a casual prompt, the others a causal-plus-solution prompt (i.e., “what
we can do about it”). 3. Essay writing according to the inquiry prompt
instructions: “provide an explanation for how and why global
temperatures are changing from a document set that contained several
documents, each of which described different aspects of the phenomenon”.
3. Participants completed a verification task to check comprehension. 4.
Demographic survey - included an enjoyment of the task measure

## 8.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Causal-plus-solution prompt group: “Your task is to use this
set of documents to write an essay explaining how and why recent
patterns in global temperature are different from what has been observed
in the past and what we can do about it. Be sure to use specific
information from the documents to support your conclusions and ideas.”
(the other group was not shown the phrase “what we can do about it”). An
inference verification task was used to provide converging evidence for
comprehension.

**Analysis**: Chi-square test (essay was scored categorically) x2 =
4,84, p = ,028.

**Results**: Essays were an average of 19.60 (SD = 6.56) sentences long,
with no differences between conditions, all Fs(1, 41) \< 1. Essays in
the core-documents condition provided more coverage of the important
concepts (M =4.59, SD = 1.30) than did essays in the policy-plus-core
document condition (M = 3.79, SD = .88), F(1, 41) = 4.80, p = .034, d =
.79. No other effects were significant. Essays in the policy-plus-core
document condition were even less likely (46% vs. 64%) to include the
concept of human energy sources releasing CO2, which is the same
connection that is used to support fuel-use changes in the policy
document.

**Improved?**: Better knowledge is understood as more references to
causal mechanisms leading to climate change and more references to the
human role in it. “Students were asked to write an essay”explaining”
changes in “global temperatures” (…) Each essay was coded categorically
for whether or not it attempted to provide an explanation for global
climate change. An essay could be marked as attempting to provide an
explanation for global climate change even if the explanation was
incorrect. As long as a student was attempting to explain causal
mechanisms that led to global climate change, their essay would be
marked as an explanation, even if they also suggested solutions or
policy changes that could help reduce climate change…)“.”

## 8.6 Outcomes

)

**other**: Task enjoyment: enjoyment was positively correlated with
concept coverage in the essays (r = ,26, p = ,04) yet negatively
correlated with inclusion of policy information (r = 2,28, p = ,03).
(*Worked?*: Correlation )

## 8.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “The results of this experiment suggest that the
inclusion of a single brief policy document can impact performance on a
multiple-document inquiry task: altering the type of information
students include in their essays, reducing inclusion of key concepts and
causal links needed to provide the requested causal explanation, and
increasing inclusion of policy-related information.”

**Message to keep:**: Policy mentions and side-taking came at the
expense of including causal information.

**title** The Effectiveness of the Geospatial Curriculum Approach on
Urban Middle-Level Students’ Climate Change Understandings

## 9.1 abstract

Climate change science is a challenging topic for student learning. This
quantitative study examined the effectiveness of a geospatial curriculum
approach to promote climate change science understandings in an urban
school district with eighth-grade students and investigated whether
teacher- and student-level factors accounted for students’ climate
change knowledge achievement. The participants included 12 science
teachers and 956 eighth-grade students. Data included a pre- and
posttest climate change assessment measures for both teachers and
students and a teacher measure of Geospatial Science-Technological
Pedagogical Content Knowledge. Paired-sample t tests revealed
statistically significant gains from pretest to posttest on their
climate change knowledge (p \< .001; effect sizes being large on
multiple-choice items and medium on the open-ended response assessment).
Both ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression and 2-level
hierarchical linear modeling found that students’ initial climate change
knowledge and gender were significant predictors for students’ posttest
scores, p \< .05. Students’ pretest scores were the strongest
significant predictor of the posttest scores, p \< .001. Neither the
teachers’ climate change knowledge nor their Geospatial
Science-Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge had significant
association with the students’ posttest scores. Teaching years was a
significant predictor for students’ posttest scores in OLS regression (p
\< .001). The findings provide support that a geospatial curriculum
approach is an effective science curriculum approach for learners in
urban middle-level education.

## 9.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

1.  to examine the efficacy of a technology-integrated curriculum that
    used geospatial technologies to promote urban middle-level students
    understandings of important climate change science concepts.
2.  to investigate factors related to both students and teachers that
    may account for the variance in students’ climate change knowledge
    achievement.

**Questions**:

1.  Whether and to what extent can a geospatial curriculum approach
    promote climate change understandings with students in urban
    middle-level education?
2.  What factors related to both students and teachers may account for
    students climate change knowledge achievement?

## 9.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Curriculum (lessons, class activities, investigation)

**Description**: The Climate Change curriculum included a coherent
sequence of topics and learning activities designed to promote learner
understandings about the atmosphere, Earth system energy balance,
weather and climate, greenhouse gases, paleoclimatology, and
environmental impacts of human-induced climate change and it has five
lessons during 20-day instructional sequence approach with Google Earth.
The curriculum also included lessons with a Webbased interactive carbon
calculator and geologic time line, inquiry-based laboratories,
demonstrations, readings, and modeling activities aligned to the
curriculum learning goals.

## 9.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-post assessment measure included 28 multiple-choice items
and 3 open-ended response items

**Analysis**: To address the first research question in a
straightforward fashion, paired-sample t tests were conducted in IBM
SPSS 21 to examine whether the mean scores of the climate change
assessment items were significantly different between the pretest and
the posttest. - Two approaches in total were tried to address the second
research question. We first tried the ordinary least squares (OLS)
multiple regression analysis using the blockwise method in IBM/SPSS 21
to investigate how well the teacher factors accounted for the variance
in students’ climate change posttest scores, after controlling for
students’ gender and pretest scores. Secondly, for the purpose of
incorporating the data structure that students were nested within
teachers, we conducted a series of two-level hierarchical linear models
(HLM).

**Results**: The standard effect size for the urban students in our
study had an effect size of 1.29 for the entire climate change
assessment measure. These results speak favorably to using the
geospatial curriculum approach to promote growth in students’ climate
change understandings. - After the curriculum implementation, the
students identified more anthropogenic sources that contribute to
climate change, environmental impacts, and solutions to enhanced
anthropogenic climate change at a personal and societal level.

**Improved?**: overall results regarding the use of the Climate Change
curriculum showed significan improvement in urban middle-level students’
climate change science understandings for the entire assessment and for
each topic area subgroup

## 9.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: significant improvement in urban middle-level students’
climate change science understandings (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: After the curriculum implementation, the students
identified more anthropogenic sources that contribute to climate change,
environmental impacts, and solutions to enhanced anthropogenic climate
change at a personal and societal level. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 9.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The findings from this study illustrate that
implementing a coherent middle-level climate change science curriculum
using a geospatial curriculum approach to learning can enhance urban
middle-level students’ understandings of important climate science
topics and help foster a deeper understanding of climate change science.

**Message to keep:**: The results from this study provide support for
the effectiveness of the geospatial curriculum approach to enhance the
climate change content knowledge of urban middle-level students. The
findings also provide support that a geospatial curriculum approach may
be an effective science curriculum approach for learners in urban
middle-level education. Virtual globes such as Google Earth are
interactive visualization tools that can be designed to enable learners
to manipulate, analyze, and synthesize spatial data in novel ways and
support the development of contextually rich learning environments that
promote higher-order thinking skills, meaningful learning, and authentic
scientific inquiry.

**title** Middle and high school students’ conceptions of climate change
mitigation and adaptation strategies

## 10.1 abstract

Both scientists and policy-makers emphasize the importance of education
for influencing pro-environmental behavior and minimizing the effects of
climate change on biological and physical systems. Education has the
potential to impact students’ system knowledge - their understanding of
the variables that affect the climate system - and action knowledge -
their understanding of behaviors that can impact the system. Research on
climate change education has largely focused on system and action
knowledge that address mitigation while overlooking equally necessary
adaptive responses. This study used a pre/post-test format to identify
aspects of middle and high school students’ climate system knowledge and
action knowledge of both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.
Results indicate that adolescents currently conflate climate change
mitigation strategies with unrelated environmental problems far less
than in previous surveys. However, students demonstrated limited
understanding of adaptive responses to climate change. After engaging in
an instructional unit on climate change, students expressed stronger
system and action knowledge, but significant misconceptions remained
that conflated mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.

**title** Pre-Service Teachers and Climate Change: A Stalemate?

## 11.1 abstract

Findings from the second phase of a study of pre-service teachers’
attitudes to environmental education and knowledge of climate change are
reported in this paper. A sample of 87 pre-service teachers participated
in a survey study in the last year of their Bachelor of Education degree
to examine developments to their attitudes to environmental education
and their knowledge of climate change as a result of training. Results
showed their attitudes towards environmental education were consistently
favourable, but their climate change science knowledge had not changed
as a result of their participation in their degree. Data on preservice
teachers’ sources of knowledge for climate change, their views on
important substantive climate change knowledge for their future students
and their perceptions of gaps in their own training in relation to
climate change were also investigated in order to triangulate the survey
data. Implications for preservice teacher education are discussed.

**title** THE EFFECTS OF INSTRUCTION WITH VISUAL MATERIALS ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF PRESERVICE ELEMENTARY TEACHERS’ KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE
TOWARDS GLOBAL WARMING

## 12.1 abstract

This study aimed to identify the erroneous knowledge and misconceptions
of preservice elementary teachers about global warming and examine the
effects of instruction with visual materials on rectifying these
misconceptions and fostering a positive attitude towards the issue of
global warming. Having a quasi-experimental design, the study made use
of both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The participants
of the study, which was conducted in 2008-2009 academic year in Giresun
University’s Education Faculty, were 47 preservice elementary teachers.
Data were obtained by using open ended questions, the Global Warming
Attitude Scale (GWAS) and semi-structured interview forms. The results
showed that both experimental and control group individuals had
knowledge gaps and certain misconceptions about the reasons underlying
global warming. However, preservice teachers were more successful in
rectifying the gaps and misconceptions via instruction with visual
materials. After the intervention, the experimental group had higher
global warming attitude scores. However, no meaningful relationship
existed between the groups with respect to their attitude scores.

**title** Investigating Preservice Elementary Science Teachers’
Understanding of Climate Change from a Computational Thinking Systems
Perspective

## 13.1 abstract

There is a need to approach environmental education (EE) topics, such as
climate change, with a framework that productively reflects its inherent
complexity. This study investigates how computational thinking (CT),
specifically systems thinking (ST), may prepare educators to teach
climate change. As scientists increasingly rely on computational
techniques in their studies of complex EE topics, it is incumbent on
science education to provide learners with computational thinking
opportunities. We investigated how elementary preservice teachers (PSTs)
in a science methods course (N=35) adapted a curricular resource on the
climate change topic of sea level rise to integrate the CT practice of
ST. Changes in their thinking were analyzed. Findings suggest that PSTs
prior to instruction held a limited understanding of climate systems,
often conflating weather and climate. Post instruction, their thinking
expanded to consider the relationships between carbon dioxide, global
warming, ice melt, and sea level rise. Further, many were able to
describe these systems in a future EE teaching activity for young
learners. A major implication was the need to develop a continuum of CT
practices for elementary educators, with an emphasis on ST, for complex
environmental education topics, that could frame their pedagogical
thinking for climate change education. © 2019 by the authors.

learn about a complex EE topic like climate change, and how they planned
to incorporate the topic in their own teaching, supported by a CT
framework

**Questions**:

1.  How does computational thinking, with an emphasis on systems
    thinking, support preservice elementary teachers’ thinking about
    climate change, a complex environmental education topic?
2.  How do preservice elementary teachers incorporate systems thinking
    in their proposed teaching of the environmental education topic of
    sea level rise?

## 13.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Professional development

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons with computational tools (system thinking with,
punctually the help of software), online activities

**Description**: This study focuses on 2 weeks (10 and 11) from the
science method course for undergraduate preservice teachers. - week 10:
Climate change and computational thinking: PSTs learn about assessment
in the context of weather and climate change with an emphasis on the CT
practice of systems thinking - week 11: Blended learning, Sea Level Rise
and computational thinking: PSTs continue with assessment and climate
change with a focus on technology and blended learning. PSTs complete an
online activity on sea level rise and how it will affect a geographic
community using data and projections from the Surging Seas website
(Climate Central, 2018)

## 13.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Before and after session 1, preservice teachers were asked to
respond online to the prompt: “List up to three science related
questions you have about climate systems and climate change. This might
involve the interrelationships between factors, how different factors
affect each other, or connections between humans and climate change.”
Data were collected and coded for the number and type of systems in
their pre and post responses. independent interrater agreement was
approximately 90%, with subsequent negotiation among the three raters
resulting in over 95% agreement. After session 2, they responded to the
following prompt: “Within the context of climate change, what
systems/systems models do you now know inform a scientific understanding
of sea level rise, and how would you use such models to teach upper
elementary students how scientists think about the causes of sea level
rise with an emphasis on systems thinking?” Using the instrument
developed earlier, responses were coded and codes tabulated. While data
were not collected prior to instruction for this prompt, the use of the
same codes allowed for comparison with their responses in the previous
section The researchers realized later that the preservice teachers did
not mention fossil fuels in their responses in session 1 and 2. Data
were collected from four PSTs using selected questions from the CSKAI
(Drewes, et al., 2017) to gain a sense of PSTs’ understanding of the
role of fossil fuels in climate change

**Analysis**: Qualitative data are coded into categories, but the
results are very descriptive, and no particular methodological approach
is described

**Results**: Pre-post session 1: - The primary change in PSTs’ questions
before and after instruction was a shift from an emphasis on the
relationship between weather and climate change towards the greenhouse
effect and the role of greenhouse gases. - PSTs shifted towards a more
mechanistic view of climate change, involving CO2 and the greenhouse
effect, their view was still constrained and might not include key
relationships between the systems involved in climate change.
Post-session 2 (Sea level rise) - their understanding developed further
to include global warming, ice melt, and sea level rise. - weather was
no longer present in their responses, suggesting they no longer
considered it a primary component of climate change. - Still absent from
their responses was the relationship between fossil fuels and other
drivers of climate change. Additional questionnaire on fossil fuels: -
The PSTs’ responses to the selected CSKAI questions indicated they
understand the connection between the use of fossil fuels, CO2, and
global warming

**Improved?**: Cognitive approach of climate change improve toward a
more structured mechanistic view

## 13.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Computational/system thinking abilities concerning
Climate Change (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 13.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Overall, we assert that it is beneficial to incorporate
CT to meaningfully enact the NGSS as well as to prepare young learners
with the expected disciplinary core knowledge, practices, and cross
cutting concepts that apply across a wide range of disciplines involving
computation

**Message to keep:**: Computational/system thinking is an important
aspect to consider when teaching climate change, in this example, it
helped pre-service teachers go beyond weather and start thinking more
systematically and mechanistically about climate change. A less central
result might be interesting to keep in mind: in this study the focus
given to system thinking on the macroscopic Sea Level Rise process
caused the student to not think about the causes of greenhouse gas
(burning fossil fuels) in their discourse.

**title** Pre-service teachers’ opinions about a two-day climate change
education workshop

## 14.1 abstract

A two-day workshop was designed in order to increase awareness of
pre-service teachers about the role of forests in adapting and
mitigating the effects of climate change. In this workshop, five
different activities were developed to reflect five sections, which are
listed as forest strengths and weakness, general knowledge on climate
change, the role of forests in climate change, forest policies and
climate change and climate refugees, were implemented as part of project
“Educating on Climate Forests.” The designed activities focused on
increasing participants’ awareness about general knowledge on climate
change, the adaptation and mitigation strategies in order to adapt
living with climate change, the climate refugee situation, the
importance of forest management and environmental conservation
strategies and the destructive effects of deforestation. The present
study investigated pre-service teachers’ opinions about the designed
activities. Through the designed activities, participants had an
opportunity to develop deeper insights into the role of forests in
adapting and mitigating the effects of climate change. After each
activity, participants’ opinions were gathered via written reflection
forms. In general, the results revealed that participants thought the
implemented activities were increased their awareness. Although they
stated that they had time and material insufficiency, they proposed
suggestions for improving the activities.

**title** Teaching the role of forests in mitigating the effects of
climate change using outdoor educational workshop

## 15.1 abstract

Background It is now essential for students to learn in the science
classroom about climate change and the part they can play in
ameliorating its consequences. This requires science teachers to have a
secure understanding of climate change. Purpose The aim of this study is
to investigate the effectiveness of a two-day outdoor educational
workshop on preservice teachers’ awareness of climate change and the
role of forests in mitigating the effects of climate change.
Participants 20 pre-service teachers voluntarily participated in the
workshop. Design and method A one-group pre-and post-test design was
used to investigate the changes in preservice teachers’ cognitive
structures after attending the workshop. Data were collected using a
word association test (pre and post) and participants’ reflection forms
(post). The cut-off technique was used in analysing the word association
test and thematic analysis was used in analysing participants’
reflection forms. Results The results indicated that the workshop
stimulated preservice teachers’ cognitive structures and conceptual
understandings of climate change. Moreover, they generally had positive
opinions about the workshop activities, emphasizing that these increased
their awareness and empathy skills. However, they also indicated a small
range of negative factors including a lack of time, materials, and
opportunity to debate, and being tired. Conclusions Non-formal outdoor
learning programmes can promote learning and increase preservice
teachers’ awareness with respect to climate change.

**title** Closing the “Hole in the Sky”: The Use of Refutation-Oriented
Instruction to Correct Students’ Climate Change Misconceptions

## 16.1 abstract

This article discusses the implementation of a pedagogical tool aimed at
the refutation of secondary school (grade ten-equivalent) students’
persistent climate change misconceptions. Using a lesson study approach,
the materials and intervention techniques used were developed
collaboratively with geography teachers. The objective is two-pronged:
to closely monitor how children learn through refutation-oriented
approach and to document how teachers process the experience. A pretest
and post-test comparison showed that there was significant improvement
in the students’ climate change conceptual understanding following the
intervention.

**title** Development of knowledge, awareness, global warming decreasing
behavior and critical thinking of grade 11 students using the Four Noble
Truths method with meta-cognitive techniques

## 17.1 abstract

This study aims to investigate the effects of learning environmental
education on the knowledge, awareness, global warming decreasing
behavior, and critical thinking of eighty grade 11 students from two
classes. The Four Noble Truths method with metacognitive techniques and
traditional teaching method were used for the investigation. The sample
was obtained by using cluster random sampling techniques. The Four Noble
Truths method with metacognitive techniques was used for forty students
that made up the experimental group while the traditional learning
method was used for the control group consisting of forty students. The
research instruments included five- lesson plans using the Four Noble
Truths method with three metacognitive techniques: intelligibility,
plausibility and wide-applicability (each plan consists of three hours
learning per week); a knowledge test on global warming; questionnaire on
global warming awareness; questionnaire on global warming decreasing
behavior; and a critical thinking test. The major findings revealed that
the experimental group and based on prior Biology learning outcome had
more knowledge, awareness, global warming decreasing behavior, and
critical thinking prior to learning. The high Biology achievers had
higher awareness of global warming in two areas, global warming
decreasing behavior in one area and critical thinking than the lower
Biology achievers in three areas. The experimental group had more
knowledge, awareness of global warming generally and in one area, global
warming decreasing behavior generally and in one area and overall
critical thinking in three aspects than the control group students. In
addition, there were statistical correlations between prior Biology
learning outcome with learning model and global warming awareness,
global warming decreasing behavior, and critical thinking.

**title** Arguemntation in a Socioscientific Context and its Influence
on Fundamental and Derived Science Literacies

## 18.1 abstract

This study explored the effects of arguing to learn in a socioscientific
context on the fundamental and derived components of reading, writing,
and science understanding as integral parts of science literacy. We
adopted mixed-methods in which the 1-group pretest-posttest design with
supplemental interviews and questionnaires. The pretest evaluated the
dependent variables (reading and writing scores), the treatment was
arguing to learn about the global climate change issue, the posttest
evaluated the dependent variables, and follow-up questionnaires and
interviews informed the quantitative results. An intact grade six class
(N = 28) at an urban elementary school located in central Taiwan was the
participants. Analyses of the pretest-posttest gain scores and
correlations between these outcomes revealed significant (p \< 0.05)
improvements in writing and associations among reading, writing, and
arguing to learn. Interpretation of the qualitative data (interview and
questionnaire responses) supported that argumentation as an
instructional treatment focused on fundamental literacy could play a
positive role in facilitating students’ enhanced science understanding
(derived literacy).

## 18.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

NA

**Questions**:

1)  Could arguing to learn about global climate change as fundamental
    literacy enhance the fundamental and derived literacy components of
    reading, writing, and understanding?
2)  What were the correlations between these fundamental and derived
    literacy components?
3)  What were the qualitative benefits of using arguing to learn (focus
    on fundamental literacy practices) to enhance students’ fundamental
    literacy practices and science understanding?

## 18.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, “Arguing to learn”

**Description**: This 7-week study included three phases:
reading–writing activity/pretest, arguing to learn/treatment, and
reading–writing activity/posttest. Week 2 and the remaining class time
in weeks 1, 3, and 4 were focused on the textbook and teaching the
Weather unit. 1. Phase 1 focused on fundamental literacy practices and
science understanding that involved directed activities related to texts
(DARTs; Wellington & Osborne, 2001) and to complete a global climate
change reading–writing worksheet. DARTs utilized the
constructive–interpretative language arts pair of reading–writing and
integrated the literacy practices of learning to read and write. 2.
Phase 2, the instruction phase (90 min in week 3), used arguing to learn
about socioscientific issues and focused on learning and using
fundamental literacy practices. After the warm-ups, the students were
arranged to individually finish the arguing-to-learn worksheet 2 days
later within 30 min during the single class period. The teacher
encouraged students to actively use the learned skills, but he did not
provide any answers related to Fig. 2; this process focused on students
using the argumentation task (a fundamental literacy practice) they had
learned and the literacy practices about the global climate change
issue. 3. Phase 3 repeated the phase 1 reading–writing activity and
posttest (90 min distributed in three class periods in week 4) using the
same textual materials.

## 18.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: ten question for text comprehension (true/false) PREPOST -
Essay writing scored using four dimension (content, organization, word
choice, sentence structure) PREPOST - Arguments cell in a worksheet
(arguing to learn in a structured worksheet) were scored as well (POST
activity ONLY) - Finally, qualitative data from the follow-up
questionnaires and interviews were analyzed. The questionnaire was
designed to collect all participants’ viewpoints and learning
experiences on (a) arguing to learn a socioscientific issue and (b) the
learning benefits from using argumentation as a fundamental literacy
practice in the global climate change context. Eight students were
randomly selected for interview by the second author as a case sample
(POST ONLY)

**Analysis**: Quantitative: Analysis of quantitative data involved
calculating descriptive statistics, testing gain scores, and exploring
the correlations among the variables. Paired-sample t tests were used to
analyze pretest–posttest changes in the participants’ reading
comprehension and essay writing. Pearson correlation coefficients were
used to analyze the associations between the fundamental and derived
literacy components in an attempt to investigate how these literacy
components support and complement each other. Qualitative: Using open
coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1998), two researchers analyzed the
questionnaire and interview responses; they read and coded all the
verbatim responses individually and then discussed their discrepant
codes to reach consensus. We employed triangulation to guard against
misinterpretation of data and to build credibility of the qualitative
data (Sadler & Zeidler, 2005)

**Results**: Reading Comprehension as Derived Literacy: The analysis of
pretest and posttest scores of reading comprehension related to science
understanding about the global climate change issue (Table 1) revealed
no significant gain, t = −0.124, p = 0.902. We had not predicted that
the effect of active reading from the DARTs reading–writing activity
would lead to high levels of science understanding on the pretest and
posttest (8.68, 8.71, respectively, out of ten possible points). Thus,
this ceiling effect limited the potential learning influence from using
argumentation in supporting students’ reading comprehension Essay
Writing as Fundamental Literacy: Analysis of the pretest and posttest
essay writing scores related to fundamental literacy practices (Table 1)
revealed significant gains. The paired-sample t test of the students’
performance on all of the posttest scoring items demonstrated
significant (p \< 0.05) progress over the pretest performance. The
improvement on the total essay writing score was a large effect size, d
= 1.43; the improvement on the content item was a medium effect size, d
= 0.57; and the improvements on the organization, word choice, and
sentence structure items were large effect size, d = 1.43, 1.29, and
1.22, respectively. These medium to large effect sizes meant that the
arguing-to-learn treatment likely contributed to the performances on
essay writing, organization, word choice, and sentence structure.
Benefits of Using Argumentation (Qualitative analysis): Three benefits
of the argumentation experience on learning to read and write at the
posttest phase were reported by the students interviewed: (i) ntegrating
argumentation experience with the reading–writing worksheet task
encouraged the students to determine and evaluate whether or not the
results were beneficial to global climate change, (ii) the experiences
of arguing to learn could guide the students to do structured thinking
by warrant/backing/rebbutal (pro) and W/B/R (con) when doing the
reading–writing activity in the posttest, (iii) the arguing-to-learn
experiences could encourage the students to consider the global climate
change issue for better and thorough science understanding

**Improved?**: Essay writing as fundamental literacy has improved Text
comprehension as derived literacy has not improved, but the pretest
score were so high that there were not much space for improvement The
students completed well the structured arguments in the arguing to learn
activity

## 18.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - derived literacy (reading comprehension on CC texts) -
fundamental literacy (essay writing) - capacity of arguing (structure of
arguments counter-argument etc) (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 18.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Through the activity of arguing to learn about the
global climate change issue, the students internalized the literacy
practices by combining reading and writing with arguing to learn, which
had significant teaching–learning benefits.

**Message to keep:**: In Taiwan, the use of an “arguing to learn”
pedagogical strategy seems to have a good impact in terms of “science
literacy” (writing/reading on climate change) on relatively young
learners (~11-12 years old). Note that the “arguing” part of the
intervention consisted in exploring a warrant/backing/rebuttal structure
on arguments and counter-arguments (in an excel worksheet!), not in a
lively discussion between students

**title** The Impacts of a Climate Change SSI-STEAM Program on Junior
High School Students’ Climate Literacy

## 19.1 abstract

This study aims to investigate climate literacy among junior high school
students participating in an SSI-STEAM climate change education program
and to examine the impacts of the program on the cultivation of climate
literacy. Thirty- one eighth-grade students in Seoul, Korea,
participated in this study. Data were collected using pre- and
post-program surveys with a climate literacy questionnaire (CLQ),
students’ background survey questions, interviews with participants, and
from the artifacts produced by students during the program.
Participants’ climate literacy was shown to improve substantially after
attending the program, especially in the domains of perception and
action. The four characteristics of climate literacy change were
identified in the participants’ responses: more concrete ideas,
extension of the scope of thinking, positive responsibility, and
relevance recognition. The climate literacy program developed showed
potential for fostering young people’s climate literacy along with their
understanding of responsible national and global citizenship. The study
discusses the implications of these findings and includes suggestions
for future climate literacy program development and for both curricular
and extra-curricular climate change education that can together nurture
students’ more profound understanding of climate change.

**title** A glance at mathematical modeling from an ecological
perspective: the problem of “Pine Processionary Caterpillar Invasion”

## 20.1 abstract

The purpose of this paper is to integrate mathematical modeling and
ecology by presenting an activity involving an authentic environmental
problem, which is called “Pine Processionary Caterpillars Invasion.”
Adopting Mathematical Modeling and Education for Climate Action (EfCA)
approaches, it was aimed to encourage pre-service teachers (PSTs) to use
the power of mathematical modeling processes to make inferences from
data and evidence and make informed decisions by producing action plans
to solve an ecological problem caused by climate change. The study was
conducted with eight pre-service mathematics teachers and eight
pre-service science teachers in a public university in Turkey. All PSTs
worked as groups so that their mastery and thinking styles enriched each
other. At the end of the activity, we noticed that some of the
pre-service teachers confronted difficulties such as coming up with a
working mathematical model, collecting real-world data from the pine
forests, and efficiently computing steps of mathematical modeling
without any errors. However, pre-service teachers could make use of the
views of their working partners having different disciplines and
appreciated the usefulness of mathematical modeling to solve an
ecological problem. They also realized the interconnectedness of species
and developed empathy for the welfare of society and nature.

## 20.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The ultimate goal was to awaken the pre-service teachers’ awareness of
the cross-curricular nature of ecological problems and climate change.

**Questions**:

NA

## 20.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Professional Development

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: A mathematical problem case

**Description**: The PSTs (Pres-service teachers) are given a
mathematical problem case and because PSTs may or may not be familiar
with the mathematical modeling processes, semi-structured worksheets
were designed so that PSTs may guide themselves in finding solutions to
a selected ecological problem. Worksheets and important numerical
variables and ratios were provided implicitly, rather than explicitly so
that PSTs needed further calculations specific to their purpose. After
they introduced the problem, the PSTs started making nature
observations, collecting real-world data, computing mathematical
calculations, and considering assumptions given (or even making new
assumptions) to get some solutions.

## 20.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: The different mathematical models based on data from the
observations and collecting real- world data.

**Analysis**: NA

**Results**: By computing mathematical modeling processes to solve the
local, authentic, and challenging ecological problem, the pre-service
teachers became aware of the importance of nature’s ecological balance
that is in danger and noticed how species in forests are interrelated
and dependent on each other.

**Improved?**: By computing mathematical modeling processes to solve the
local, authentic, and challenging ecological problem, the pre-service
teachers became aware of the importance of nature’s ecological balance
that is in danger and noticed how species in forests are interrelated
and dependent on each other.

## 20.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: pre-service teachers’ awareness of the cross-curricular
nature of ecological problems and climate change. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 20.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The context of the activity is also appropriate for
high school students since environmental problems for ecological balance
and climate change are core topics covered in science courses and the
same for proportional relations and linear equations in the mathematics
courses in high schools. Therefore, the students aged 14–18 would also
be engaged in the activity.

**Message to keep:**: PSTs (pre-service teachers) indicated that they
improved their mathematical modeling competencies and problem-solving
skills and started paying more attention to the relations of species in
nature which they did not before and that they intend to apply such
interdisciplinary activities in their practicum and future career to
help their students to be holistic thinking problem solvers.

## 21.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To present an experience of inclusion of the theme “climate change” in a
Brazilian public school through training, conducted with teachers.

**Questions**:

How do teachers view climate change at present and in the future? What
are the practices that can be inserted into the school context to assist
in the process of mitigating the effects of climate change? After
conducting research (CCE training) what is the teachers’ level of
knowledge, behavior and attitude?

## 21.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Several activities with different approaches (descriptive,
illustrative, theoretical and narrative, among others) have been
performed with the group of teachers.

**Description**: Instructions of topics. All materials developed during
the training process were didactic/pedagogical references of the UNESCO
(2014) document. When comparing the results before and after the
teachers’ qualifications, it can be observed that for all domains
(knowledge, attitude and behavior) the mean scores were always higher in
the post-moment, and this difference in the total score evaluation was
significant

## 21.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test / post-test

**Analysis**: For the analysis of the answers before and after the
training, statistical analyses were performed for the quantitative
variables, obtained by the total score, considering the three domains of
interest of the research. All variables followed normal distribution,
verified by the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Then, the parametric tests
were used; Student’s t-test for paired samples to compare the mean
scores of the four teachers participating in the research in the pre-
and post-training moments. And then the Pearson correlation test was
used to correlate the three domains of the score at both times (pre- and
post-test). Finally, an alpha (a) value less than or equal to 5 per cent
was considered as statistically significant and the statistical software
PASWStatistics version 18.0 was used.

**Results**: When comparing the results before and after the teachers’
qualifications, it can be observed that for all domains (knowledge,
attitude and behavior) the mean scores were always higher in the
post-moment, and this difference in the total score evaluation was
significant, which obtained an average of 184.50 (6 19.74) before and
203.75 (6 11.56) after training (p = 0.031).. When correlating the
domains separately in the pre- and post-moments, it was observed that
behavior and attitude had a strong correlation with r = 0.956 (p =
0.044) in the pretraining and r = 0.827 (p = 0.173) in the
post-training, as shown in Table IX. Although statistical significance
was observed only in the pre-training, this result is also evidenced in
other studies Chappin et al. (2017), which use the same methodological
procedures. Given this, it can be said that it is likely that Teacher D
did not change his behavior, even after his participation in the
research. However, this (like the others) acquired knowledge on the
subject. According to Chappin et al. (2017), knowledge helps in more
sustainable attitudes and behaviors, but it is not a guarantee that
people will actually change habits and behavior through knowledge.

**Improved?**: Better knowlegde, attitudes and behaviours towards
Climate Change

## 21.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: When comparing the results before and after the teachers’
qualifications, it can be observed that for all domains (knowledge,
attitude and behavior) the mean scores were always higher in the
post-moment, and this difference in the total score evaluation was
significant (*Worked?*: Yes )

**action**: When comparing the results before and after the teachers’
qualifications, it can be observed that for all domains (knowledge,
attitude and behavior) the mean scores were always higher in the
post-moment, and this difference in the total score evaluation was
significant (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 21.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: However, this research reinforces that the CCE theme is
cross-sectional and can be addressed by all areas of knowledge. In this
research, the sample is small; however, it was committed to the
research, according to the results presented in the activities performed
during training (pre and post-test), verifying that the knowledge of 100
per cent of the participants increased and in 75 per cent of the
participants, attitude and behavior also improved. the teachers who
participated in this research see climate change as an opportunity for
society to develop a more sustainable behavior, a factor evidenced in
the analysis of the SDGs.

**Message to keep:**: There is an importance of using different
approaches in the instructions of teachers, specially in climate change
education. This paper reflect that the use of different strategies
(e.g. descriptive, illustrative, theoretical andnarrative, among others)
could be useful in the change of attitudes, behaviors and knowledge, and
this change may affect their students and community.

**title** An Analysis of the Teachers’ Climate Change Awareness

## 22.1 abstract

This paper reports a study conducted to investigate social studies and
science teachers’ awareness on climate change and how the professional
development workshop “Awareness and Adaptation to Climate Change”
affects teachers’ awareness level. For this purpose, a total of 101
teachers from 8 different cities and 4 geographical locations
participated in the workshop and took part in the study. For data
collection purposes, the Awareness to Climate Change Questionnaire
(ACCQ) was used. The analysis revealed no statistical difference among
participating teachers’ awareness level based on pre-test scores.
However, further analysis indicates an increase in awareness on climate
change among participating teachers upon completion of the professional
development workshops.

## 22.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The study aimed to identify if there is any change in climate change
awareness among teachers after attending the in-service training.

**Questions**:

1)  How teachers perceive climate change? (b) Is there a difference
    between teachers’ perceptions on the issue depending on the
    geographical locations they are selected from? (c) How effective is
    the professional development program?

## 22.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor/outdoor

**Type**: in-service teacher training on Climate Change Adaptation and
Awareness through workshops.

**Description**: The selected teachers for the workshops were asked to
be present on campus one day prior, and introductory activities were
conducted to familiarize teachers with the workshop programs as well as
faculty members and facilities. Each day of the workshop was organized
around a special theme. First day: ecology and environmental problems
that we face mostly in the last century, especially global warming and
sustainable development. Second day: climate change, its impacts and
consequences for us and the ways to be followed for adaptation and
mitigation. Third day: energy including the subtopics of efficient ways
of energy consumption and sustainable energy resources in the world. The
workshops were structured around instruction, discussions, hands on
activities and field trips.

## 22.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test/ post-test

**Analysis**: Analysis of a variance test used to examine whether there
were any differences among participants originating from different
geographical regions of Turkey based on pre-test scores. Further
analysis was conducted through paired sample t-test analysis.

**Results**: ANOVA results revealed that there were no statistical
differences among the four groups in terms of climate change awareness
before the training F (3, 97) = 0.525, p = 0.66. there was a
statistically significant difference between the mean scores of science
and social science teachers’ overall awareness to climate change before
and after the in-service training. The eta-squared statistics 0.31
indicated a moderate effect size (Cohen, 1988). Having established that
there was a statistically significant difference, the mean values were
examined to find which set of scores were higher (ACC1 or ACC2). The
pre-test mean scores of overall climate change awareness was calculated
3.31 meaning that the teachers reported that they were aware of the
topic. The post-test mean score was calculated as 3.84 indicating a
stronger awareness presented in Table 5. Based on the calculated mean
values and t-test analysis, a statistically significant increase was
found between pre- and post-test scores of the participating teachers.

**Improved?**: Increased level of awareness

## 22.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: Raise awareness on climate change (*Worked?*: YES )

## 22.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Pre-test results also revealed that although climate
change is related to the field of teaching, social studies and science
in-service teachers are unaware of the climate change issue. Both the
overall questionnaire and the subscales analysis revealed that teachers
have awareness on the topic. Since both social studies and science
curriculum include content on climate change, it is expected to have
teachers to have at least a basic understanding and awareness on the
topic. Although the increase in teachers’ awareness of global climate
change is not large, this outcome shows a positive impact of the
workshop on participating teachers’ awareness on climate change.

**Message to keep:**: The use of workshops to raise awareness on climate
change could be a useful approach to teach this topic. The results shown
that participants had some gains in terms of knowledge when they don’t
have it.

**title** Bridging the Action Gap by Democratizing Climate Change
Education—The Case of k.i.d.Z.21 in the Context of Fridays for Future

## 23.1 abstract

Formal schooling frequently lacks both democratic learning culture and
effective climate change education (CCE). This study analyzes the
effects of the participatory CCE initiative k.i.d.Z.21 and the impacts
of the current Fridays For Future (FFF) climate protests on teenagers’
climate change awareness. The mixed-methods approach comprises online
pre-and post-tests, and personal interviews with selected students.
k.i.d.Z.21 follows moderate constructivist, inquiry-based learning
approaches and addresses 14-year old students from secondary schools in
Austria and southern Germany. Considering the effectiveness of the CCE
intervention of school year 2018/2019 (N = 169), quantitative findings
reveal an increased mean of major components of climate change
awareness, including climate-friendly behavior. When separating
participants and non-participants in Fridays For Future, personal
concern and refusing meat have both increased significantly only among
protest participants. A closer examination of this group identifies an
enhanced feeling of self-efficacy that might be triggered by perceived
collective efficacy. Besides, more climate-friendly consumption
behavior, as well as enhanced multiplicative action, are detected. The
interviewed students also clearly assigned increased action-related
components of climate change awareness to the attendance of FFF. From
the findings, we conclude that democratic learning in and out of school
can enhance action-related components of climate change awareness, and a
combination of both can have an even stronger effect.

## 23.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Evaluating the effect of the k.i.d.Z.21 programme and investigate
whether components of climate change awareness differ among participant
to the “Friday For Future” protest participants and non-participants

**Questions**:

NA

## 23.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular/Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lessons / Research projects / One week field trip

**Description**: k.i.d.Z.21 takes place during all the academic year
with various modules - kick-off workshop (plenary discussions with
diverse actors, transdisciplinary) - classical school lessons -
individual research projects - 3 modules in the “High alpine Research
Week” with experts (tourism, environmental ethics, vegtation, soil,
glacier etc)

## 23.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre- post- questionnaire 20-minutes semi-structured individual
interviews for 10 students who participated in the Friday For Future
protests

**Analysis**: t-test to compare pre- and post test effect size
calculated based on Bravais-Pearson, and Cohen interpretation Cronbach’s
alpha on the questionnaire to measure scale reliability Interviews were
conducted on students participating in “Friday for future” and analysed
with structured content analyses

**Results**: $$AWARENESS$$ Awareness improved for all students, in all
the different aspect “Responsability” and “locus of control” were higher
for students participating in protests before and after interventions
The mean change of “Level of concern” and “self-efficacy” was higher for
students participating in protest $$INTENTION$$ mean behavioral change
(engagement and multiplicative actions) improved for all students but
more in students participating in protest $$HABIT$$ Change of diet
(refusal of meet) only occured in FFF protest participants, who also
mention consumption behavior change (88.9%) $$KNOWLEDGE$$ Improved for
all students, but more in FFF protest participants

**Improved?**: Concerning awareness, knowledge, intention all students
improved, with higher improvement for the Friday For Future (FFF)
protest participants. Concerning habits, the improvement is particularly
seen in FFF participants

## 23.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness in questionnaire in question concerning
tourism, ethics, vegetation/soil and glaciers (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - Sense of responsability - Self-efficacy (sense of
competence) - locus of control (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: Part of behavior which is not related with particular
habits or actions (multiplier effect and general behavior change)
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**habit**: Behavior change such as diet, transport, consumption
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 23.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Climate change awareness could be enhanced by the
learning intervention of k.i.d.Z.21 in all students. Combination of the
educative interventions from k.i.d.Z.21 and the participation in the
Friday For Future protests can be mutually beneficial. Action-related
components of students’ CCA are strengthened, student motivation
increases, and practical skills are developed.

**Message to keep:**: Beyond a quite positive effect of the k.i.d.Z.21
one-year programme, on numerous students and on various outcomes
concerning CC behavior and awareness, the originality of this paper is
to show a potential complementarity effect of the student participation
in the Friday For Future protest movement.This show that the effect of
CCE is part of a complex environment which may influence children toward
change, and this might be the key for the knowledge action gap.

**title** Improving Climate Literacy With Project-Based Modules Rich in
Educational Rigor and Relevance

## 24.1 abstract

Project-based climate change instructional modules were developed and
used in middle and high school classrooms. The modules were created to
develop higher-order thinking skills with real-world data and models
describing climate systems and approaches to mitigate or adapt to
changes. The objective of this paper is to identify the relationships
between specific attributes of the project-based climate modules used in
classrooms and resulting gains in middle and high school students’
climate literacy. Modules were assessed to define the level of rigor and
relevance associated with the learning activities. A climate literacy
questionnaire that included cognitive, affective (including
self-efficacy), and behavioral items was administered to students before
and after the modules were taught. Overall, students made modest but
statistically significant gains on the cognitive (p ≪ 0.001) and the
affective (p \< 0.01) climate literacy subscales. Results of the fixed
effects analysis of covariance showed a significant difference among
classrooms on students’ cognitive (p \< 0.001), behavioral (p = 0.001),
and self-efficacy (p = 0.015) performance; both the teacher and the
specific content taught varied among classrooms. Two specific teachers
and the modules they developed and taught were defined as exemplars
based on the significant climate literacy gains made by their students.
Both of these modules, one middle school level and one high school
level, used roleplay projects that expected students to acquire and
analyze historical temperature data and predictions of the future
climate at various locations around the world. Middle school students
played the role of an individual living in a different country and
culture, while the high school students each acted as a science adviser
to a political delegate attending a world climate conference. Students
at both levels made highly significant gains in the cognitive subscale,
and the middle school students improved their literacy in the affective,
self-efficacy, and behavioral subscales. The breadth of climate issues
covered and the depth of analysis of real-world data and situations were
identified as critical attributes of these particular modules that led
to improved climate literacy. © 2014 National Association of Geoscience

**title** Lesson Worksheets: A Tool for Developing Youth Weather and
Climate Science Comprehension

## 25.1 abstract

At an Extension youth agricultural science center, our team developed
and pilot tested a five-lesson weather and climate science curriculum
for middle school-aged youths. As part of the endeavor, we conducted an
item analysis of the five worksheets used across the lessons and
determined relationships between worksheet scores and pretest/posttest
science comprehension improvement scores. Results from 88 primarily
Hispanic eighth graders indicated that worksheet performance was related
to overall science comprehension, science knowledge, and weather and
climate resiliency in agriculture and natural resources lesson
improvement scores. Results support the use of formative scaffolding
tools such as worksheets in Extension youth programming to improve youth

**title** Assessing the Impact of a Weather and Climate Curriculum on
Youth Science Comprehension

## 26.1 abstract

The researchers developed a youth weather and climate curriculum using a
science comprehension model that integrates experiential and
inquiry-based learning approaches with developing science knowledge,
science skills, and reasoning abilities. The purpose of this study was
to pilot the curriculum to determine if it would improve youth science
comprehension. Participants were 8th grade, predominately Hispanic and
economically disadvantaged youths, at a middle school in Las Vegas, New
Mexico served by an innovative Extension youth agricultural science
center. Youths were taught five weather and climate science lessons that
included setting up experiments and developing and testing hypotheses
for local climate trends from online weather station data. After being
taught the curriculum, youths improved in overall science comprehension
and its subdimensions of science knowledge, science skills, and
reasoning abilities. Their science comprehension also improved for four
of five lessons. The number of youths preferring learning by doing over
other learning modalities also increased from pretest to posttest.
Youths most frequently mentioned the experiments, that the earth is
getting warmer, and the greenhouse effect and gasses when asked what
interested them about the lessons. Pilot test results were used to
strengthen the curriculum before making it available to educators
online. Further research is recommended to establish the curriculum’s
impact on science comprehension retention and on science comprehension
development when the curriculum is used as part of an elementary to
secondary learning progression.

**title** Professional development design considerations in climate
change education: teacher enactment and student learning

## 27.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing society,
and climate change educational models are emerging in response. This
study investigates the implementation and enactment of a climate change
professional development (PD) model for science educators and its impact
on student learning. Using an intrinsic case study methodology, we
focused analytic attention on how one teacher made particular
pedagogical and content decisions, and the implications for student’s
conceptual learning. Using anthropological theories of conceptual
travel, we traced salient ideas through instructional delivery and into
student reasoning. Analysis showed that students gained an increased
understanding of the enhanced greenhouse effect and the implications of
human activity on this enhanced effect at statistically significant
levels and with moderate effect sizes. However, students demonstrated a
limited, though non-significant gain on the likely effects of climate
change. Student reasoning on the tangible actions to deal with these
problems also remained underdeveloped, reflecting omissions in both PD
and teacher enactment. We discuss implications for the emerging field of
climate change education.

## 27.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The research presented here reports on the design, pedagogical enactment
and subsequent effects on student learning of a climate change
professional development (PD) model in the United States. We focus
attention on how one teacher made specific curricular and pedagogical
decisions in light of her participation in climate change PD.

**Questions**:

1)  How did a middle-school teacher integrate climate change concepts
    into her science curriculum following PD participation?
2)  How did climate change instruction influence student understanding
    of key climate change constructs?

## 27.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Professional development

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lessons, discussions, experiments, outdoor activities

**Description**: Year-long climate academy programme for teachers
professional development: (a) an intensive residential week-long summer
institute (46 h); (b) four virtual follow-up sessions on challenging
climate change concepts; and (c) two face-to-face follow-up sessions
focusing on pedagogical methods for teaching about climate change

## 27.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: We engaged as active participant observers, both taking field
notes and interacting with participating teachers as they engaged in PD
activities. We collected daily reflections where all participants
reflected on what was learned, articulated remaining questions, and
noted additional supports needed. Finally, we collected the
implementation plans developed by all participants during the
residential summer institute. In addition to artefacts collected during
the Climate Academy, the lead author conducted classroom observations
for a period of two weeks, documenting Emma’s integration of climate
change into her existing instruction on Earth’s history and geologic
time scale through field notes and the collection of relevant student
work products. We also conducted interviews with $$the teacher$$ both
pre- and post-instruction.

**Analysis**: An abductive analytic approach was implemented to examine
qualitative documents collected from the Climate Academy and Emma’s
instructional delivery (Tavory & Timmermans, 2014). Specifically, we
first used an etic coding scheme built The first author coded the
artefact corpus according to the four pre-established conceptual
domains. Initial findings from this stage of the analysis were
triangulated against additional data sources

**Results**: Emma acknowledged that she improved her knowledge of the
carbon cycle while gaining understanding of how scientists track CO2
levels in Earth’s past - Emma acknowledged gaining a better
understanding of ice melt and thermal expansion Other results: knowledge
in terms of pedagogy: - Emma remarked about the value of interactive lab
demonstrations on how changing ocean currents are influenced by
temperature and density on her understanding of thermal expansion. - she
gained a deeper appreciation of the role of outdoor activities for
experiencing climate change first hand. - She also gained a deeper
understanding of NGSS, the role of climate change in the new standards,
and potential resources for implementation in middle-school
classrooms. - she recognised the importance of empowering students to
act to set a positive tone when discussingclimate change

**Improved?**: Better knowledge concerning CO2 measurements in
methodologies and Sea level rise mechanisms

## 27.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Gain of knowledge concerning processes and scientific
methodology in climate change science (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: Pedagogical knowledge: using pedagogical strategies
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 27.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Good effect on knowledge on Climate change and the
pedagogical strategies to present it to the students

**Message to keep:**: The paper follows a teacher and her students. The
teacher goes to a professional development program and the researchers
evaluate her gain of knowledge (good both in terms of knowledge and
pedagogy) but also those of the students (good for basic knowledge and
processes but not enough in terms of mitigation and adaptation
strategy). “A climate change education that merely presents causes and
effects of climate change will remain of limited import and unable to
address the nature of the problem in its totality.”

## 28.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, discussions experiments, outdoor activities

**Description**: The teacher who participated in the “climate academy”
infused climate change into 2 classes in classical curriculum:
watersheds, and Earth geological history. - lessons on the difference
between weather and climate and the carbon cycle - lessons with
demonstrations (experimental) on ice melt and thermal expansion -
argumentative activity using concept cartoons, where groups of students
chose different perspectives, conducted their own research, and
discussed the strengths and weaknesses of that position. - discussion on
the effects of climate change both locally and globally with introduced
personal changes, like driving less and planting trees, that her
students could take to influence their own carbon footprint

## 28.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-post questionnaire on content knowledge assessment Both
the pre- and post-instruction content knowledge assessment included
short answer written response prompts so students could demonstrate
their reasoning beyond the basic multiple-choice selection.

**Analysis**: Dependent samples t-test with effect sizes (Cohen’s d) -
Student open response justification items were analysed qualitatively to
determine potential changes following targeted instruction. Findings
from this stage were also triangulated against additional data sources
for credibility purposes.

**Results**: Out of 18 possible points, on average students scored 8.6
points on the pre-assessment compared to 10.2 points on the
post-assessment (t = 4.138, df = 41, p = .001) - small but marked shift
toward a more accurate and complex understanding of the human mechanisms
causing climate change and what might be done to mitigate the effect of
those causes - In general students updated incorrect or partial
conceptualizations of how humans were impacting the atmosphere and were
then able to translate that under standing into tangible suggestions -
Results, however, indicated small differences in the climate change
constructs on effects and mitigation and adaptation strategies. (==\>
our results indicate that students remained unclear following
instruction about what to actually do about climate change given their
newfound scientific knowledge)

**Improved?**: better knowledge concerning anthropogenic climate change
and the greenhouse effect mechanism, not concerning Mitigation and
adaptation strategies

## 28.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness of knowledge test concerning: 1 Causal human
activity impact 2 Greenhouse effect mechanism 3 Mitigation and
adaptation strategies 4 Climate change effects (*Worked?*: 1 and 2: yes
3 and 4: no )

## 28.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Good effect on knowledge concerning reality and
processes of CC, but not on mitigation and adaptation strategies. “A
climate change education that merely presents causes and effects of
climate change will remain of limitedimport and unable to address the
nature of the problem in its totality.”

**Message to keep:**: The paper follows a teacher and her students. The

**title** Supporting Students’ Learning and Socioscientific Reasoning
About Climate Change—the Effect of Computer-Based Concept Mapping
Scaffolds

## 29.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today’s
global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely
covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available
through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in
its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially
non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a
crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become
climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50,
2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal
discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their
learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This
includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex
scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to
reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as
values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused
on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding
about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and
decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although
there is evidence that “knowledge” does not guarantee pro-environmental
behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2),
191-217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate
change is an important prerequisite to change individuals’ attitudes
towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate
citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual
understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning
environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to
support senior high school students’ learning about climate change and
possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different
concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated
concept maps, as well as on students’ test performance with respect to
conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and
socioscientific decision making.

## 29.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

We aimed to make use of the potential benefits of concept mapping as a
learning strategy to promote knowledge acquisition as well as students’
reasoning and decision making processes about socioscientific issues.

**Questions**:

1.  In what ways do different concept mapping scaffolds influence the
    quality of students’

1)  concept maps with respect to the issue of climate change?
2)  concept maps with respect to possible solution strategies?

<!-- -->

2.  In what ways do different concept mapping scaffolds influence

## 29.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Concept mapping

**Description**: Four treatment conditions: (1) map generation
condition, 2) concepts-provided condition, 3) lines1-provided condition,
and 4) concepts- and lines-provided condition. Four sessions during
their normal science classes: 1 (90 min) Pretest measures • Conceptual
knowledge on climate change • General socioscientific reasoning and
socioscientific decision making • Prior experience with mind maps and
concept maps, computer literacy 2 (90 min) Learning about climate change
Students • got a computer-based introductory training on concept mapping
and use of the IHMC concept mapping tool • got a computer-based
introduction on climate change • studied different texts on the issue of
climate change • developed concept maps on climate change using the
concept mapping tool (in one of the four different treatments) 3 (90
min) Learning about climate engineering strategies Students • got a
computer-based introduction on climate engineering and presentation of a
scenario to work on • studied different texts on climate engineering
strategies • developed argumentative concept maps on the pros and cons
of different climate engineering strategies (in one of the four
different treatments) 4 (90 min) Posttest measures • Conceptual
knowledge on climate change • General socioscientific reasoning and
socioscientific decision making

## 29.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre-test/post-test

**Analysis**: A repeated measures ANOVA (treatment × measurement points)
with factual knowledge on climate change as the dependent variable was
conducted. A one-way ANOVA had shown no significant group differences on
the pretest measures (F(3, 92)=2.51, p\>.05). Table 4 shows the means
and standard deviations for factual knowledge on climate change. The
repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for time
(F(1, 92)=4.90, p\<.05, partial η2=.05) but no significant main effect
for the treatment condition (F(3, 92)=1.24, p\>.05) and no significant
interaction (F\<1).

**Results**: A repeated measures ANOVA (treatment × measurement points)
with factual knowledge on climate change as the dependent variable was
conducted. A one-way ANOVA had shown no significant group differences on
the pretest measures (F(3, 92)=2.51, p\>.05). Table 4 shows the means
and standard deviations for factual knowledge on climate change. The
repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for time
(F(1, 92)=4.90, p\<.05, partial η2=.05) but no significant main effect
for the treatment condition (F(3, 92)=1.24, p\>.05) and no significant
interaction (F\<1).

**Improved?**: Increase in students’ competence in the posttest for all
four treatment conditions. Thus, all students benefitted from the
teaching intervention in a similar way in terms of knowledge gains.

## 29.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Conceptual knowledge test on climate change scientific
reasoning throw conceptual maps (*Worked?*: YES )

## 29.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: We could successfully show that a teaching intervention
that incorporates concept mapping as “representational guidance” (Toth
et al. 2002) supports students in visualizing and structuring their
knowledge and learning about climate change as well as some aspects of
socioscientific reasoning and decision making.

**Message to keep:**: It is useful for students and their knowledge
about CC to use conceptual maps, and mostly when they are given with
relevant and interdisciplinary information to build them.

## 30.1 abstract

Preparing a literate public to critically evaluate issues related to
climate change, energy, and the environment is an important pillar
toward more sustainable societies. In this article, we focus on how
informal education and outreach programs that have a combined focus on
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and on climate
change can improve knowledge, produce interest in STEM careers, and
prepare educators to communicate and teach issues at the crossroads of
STEM and climate change. The first part of this article describes the

various parts of the United States. The second part presents, in detail,
the structure and results of the outreach program SUCCEED (the Summer
Center for Climate, Energy, and Environmental Decision-Making), a K-12
outreach program created by Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of
Engineering and Public Policy (EPP). SUCCEED aims to 1.) improve
scientific literacy through a summer program focusing on climate,
energy, and environmental decision making for students entering 10th
grade and K-12 teachers; 2.) encourage the pursuit of STEM-related
careers, and 3.) help teachers prepare curriculum in these disciplines,
to be used in their classes. This article also discusses how both the

**title** Two approaches for analyzing students’ competence of
‘evaluation’ in group discussions about climate change

## 32.1 abstract

Up until now, very few models conceptualizing students’ competence in
evaluation, argu-mentation and discourse in the context of science
education have been proposed. Most sug-gestions for analyzing this
particular competence in students are normative and the empiri-cal
support for them remains weak. The problem becomes even more severe when
such evaluations include ethical and societal perspectives as part of
the analytical parameters. In support of this topic, this paper presents
two approaches for handling students’ evaluation capabilities in the
context of multidimensional discussion situations. One approach focuses
on the quality of learners’ arguments concerning levels of
justification; the second reflects upon the quality of pupils’
complexity of argumentation. Both approaches were created us-ing group
discussion data collected for evaluation purposes. The data stems from a
curricu-lum innovation project focusing on the teaching of climate
change in four teaching do-mains: Biology, Chemistry, Physics and
Politics. Participants from 20 different learning groups conducted
semi-structured, pre- and post-group discussions on the issue of climate
change. Analysis of a total of 76 group discussions showed positive
potential in both evalu-ation grids on the topic. © 2012 IJESE.

**title** The Adventures of Carbon Bond: Using a melodramatic game to
explain CCS as a mitigation strategy for climate change

## 33.1 abstract

Policy options for mitigating climate change have been severely limited
in the USA by the clash of competing ideologies. People who oppose
policies to mitigate climate change have successfully framed climate
change as existing outside the realm of fact and empirical reality.
Instead, opponents frame the issue as a melodramatic struggle between
good and evil. While scientists and engineers tend to be uncomfortable
with melodramatic framing, we argue that melodrama resonates with
people. Constructing a different melodramatic frame can tap into
people’s tendency to conceptualize issues in terms of heroes and
villains and assist in creating a shift in the political controversy
from debating the factuality of climate change to a focus on mitigation.
We developed an educational video game that uses this frame to teach
students about climate change and carbon capture, and sequestration, to
create an understanding of CO2 as the villain and humans as heroes
through participation in mitigation strategies. The hero of this
melodrama is aided by science and technology to mitigate anthropogenic
climate change. We analyze The Adventures of Carbon Bond (c) as a medium
for educating students about climate change and shifting framing. We
begin with a discussion of melodrama and the rhetorical nature of video
games. Then, through statistical analysis of surveys completed by
students who played the game, we demonstrate that students experienced a
knowledge increase as a result of game play. We conclude by discussing
the implications of our findings for productively reframing climate
change towards an emphasis on technological mitigation. (c) 2012 Society

## 33.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

We developed The Adventures of Carbon Bond© to enable students to learn
about the science and technology related to climate change in an
atmosphere relatively free from ideological conflict.

**Questions**:

RQ1: Do students learn basic science information related to climate
change through playing The Adventures of Carbon Bond©? RQ2: Do students
learn how CCS contributes to climate change mitigation through playing
Th e Adventures of Carbon Bond©? RQ3: Do students enjoy the learning
process through playing Th e Adventures of Carbon Bond©?RQ4: Do boys and
girls learn diff erently through playing Th e Adventures of Carbon
Bond©?

## 33.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Video game

**Description**: the narrative of the game creates a melodramatic frame
that focuses on climate change mitigation by positioning players as
heroes through capturing and sequestering villainous CO2 molecules. The
storyline of the game focuses on a main character, Carbon Bond, who is
on a mission to save the planet by capturing as many rogue CO2 molecules
as possible and sequestering them in an underground formation. Being a
CO2 molecule himself, Bond separates himself from anthropogenic CO2 at
the beginning of the story by claiming to be naturally formed’ through
the carbon cycle, thus distinguishing for players the difference between
natural CO2 and CO2 from industrial operations. Bond’s adventures take
him from the smokestacks of an integrated gasification combined cycles
power plant, to the stormy coasts of the Gulf of Mexico (impacted by
increased storm intensity related to climate change), and finally to a
CO2 storage facility in the Southern Rockies where the Greenhouse Gas
Gang (anthropogenic GHGs) is locked away. The narrative begins with the
assumption that climate change is a factual problem that needs to be
solved, offers CCS as a technological solution to mitigating climate
change, and positions players to be a part of the solution by capturing
and sequestering CO2 molecules. Following a melodramatic frame, the game
presents anthropogenic CO2 as the villain and players (through the game
persona of Carbon Bond) as the heroes.

## 33.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre-test/post-test

**Analysis**: t-tests on the pre- and post-game knowledge data and
descriptive statistics for questions addressing gaming enjoyment.

**Results**: From our analysis of the students’ knowledge tests (RQ1 and
RQ2), we found a statistically signifi cant diff erence between pre-game
(M = 6.862, SD = 1.7688) and post-game scores (M = 8.448, SD = 1.7212, t
= 9.5226, DF = 115, P \<0.0001) as well as a change in score
distribution from pre- and post-gaming. To summarize, playing the game
enabled students to learn about the carbon cycle, climate change, and
geological CCS. Girls’ knowledge of these topics increased more than
boys’ knowledge.

**Improved?**: An increase in basic knowledge of the carbon cycle and
other information relevant to student learning about CCS and
anthropogenic climate change.

## 33.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increase in basic knowledge (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 33.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: we demonstrated one way that the strategic use of this
commonly used frame can enable science educators to work within
melodrama by recasting what is constituted as good and evil or
villainous and heroic. The enjoyment and signifi cant knowledge gains of
student players suggest that Th e Adventures of Carbon Bond© has the
potential to reframe the issue of climate change to villianize GHGs and
make heroes out of people (the students in this case) who combat these
emissions.

**Message to keep:**: Using video games allows students to engaged in
the discussion of climate change, and provides a valuable tool to learn
while they are enjoying the process.

**title** Evaluation of a national high school entertainment education
program: The Alliance for Climate Education

## 34.1 abstract

Ever-increasing global warming has created a societal imperative to
reach and engage youth, whose futures are at risk. In this paper, we
evaluate the climate science knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behavior and
communication impact of an entertainment-education high school assembly
program in a random sample of 49 schools (from population of 779 that
received the intervention) and a panel of 1,241 students. Pre- and
post-assembly surveys composed of questions from the Global Warming’s
Six Americas segmentation and intervention-specific measures were
administered in classrooms. We demonstrate that exposure to climate
science in an engaging edutainment format changes youths’ knowledge,
beliefs, involvement, and behavior positively and moves them to audience
segments that are more engaged in the issue. The net impact of scaled,
multi-sensory, captivating programs for youth could be a population
shift in science-informed engagement in the issue of climate change. In
addition, such programs can inspire youth for deeper engagement in
school programs, personal action, and political and consumer advocacy.

## 34.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Evaluate the climate science knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behavior and
communication impact of an entertainmenteducation high school assembly
program in a random sample of 49 schools (from population of 779 that
received the intervention) and a panel of 1,241 students.

**Questions**:

RQ1 Does attending the ACE assembly inspire students to mitigate climate
change by (a) improving their knowledge of climate science, (b)
heightening positive engagement in the climate change issue, and (c)
eliciting short-term behavior change? RQ2 Does participation in the ACE
assembly change the distribution of students in the Global Warming’s Six
Americas audience segmentation scheme? RQ3 Are student members of the
Global Warming’s Six Americas audience segments differentially affected
by the ACE assembly?

## 34.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: NA

**Description**: Alliance for Climate Education (ACE) delivered a
standardized, 50-min entertainment-education presentation on climate
science to 779 high schools during the 2011–2012 school year. The
content was based on the latest scientific sources (e.g., IPCC 2007) and
followed the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States 2013).
Presentations took place in assemblies held in gymnasiums or
auditoriums. Presenters were full-time ACE staff who memorized the
script and passed a test of climate knowledge to ensure they could
answer follow-up questions.

## 34.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre-test/post-test

**Analysis**: To answer Research Question 1, paired t-tests were used to
compare pre- and post-assembly means for outcome measures in the panel
as a whole; To answer Research Question 2, we followed the methodology
developed by Maibach and colleagues (2011b) to categorize students into
one of six audience segments according to their pre-assembly responses;
To answer Research Question 3, paired t-tests were used to compare pre-
and post-assembly means for all outcome measures except the Global
Warming’s Six Americas index.

**Results**: As shown in Table 2, students’ knowledge of climate
science, positive engagement in the issue of climate change, and all
short-term behaviors (except carrying a reusable water bottle) Climatic
Change (2014) increased significantly after attending the ACE assembly.
Effect sizes were largest for knowledge of climate science (r=0.50) and
for two of the measures of positive engagement in the climate change
issue—beliefs measured by the Global Warming’s Six Americas index and
self-efficacy for explaining global warming to others or starting a
conservation project at school (r=0.49 and 0.42, respectively). Before
the assembly, students on average marked correct answers for just over
half (mean=5.13, SD=2.49) of the ten knowledge questions. After the
assembly, students on average answered 6.52 questions correctly
(SD=2.76, t(1,240)=20.49, p \<0.001). The Global Warming’s Six Americas
index increased over a quarter of a point on a response scale ranging
from 1 to 5 (t(1,240)=19.97, p\<0.001). Selfefficacy increased from just
under the mid-point of the ten-point scale to just over the midpoint
(4.30 to 5.19, t(1,240)=16.02, p\<0.001).

**Improved?**: ACE’s 1-h, single-exposure edutainment presentation
succeeded in improving students’ knowledge of climate science, positive
engagement in the issue, and climate-related behaviors in the short
term.

## 34.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increase knowlegde about climate science using
edutainment strategies (*Worked?*: Yes )

**action**: Edutainment change behaviours (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: The use of edutaniment contributes to change attitudes
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 34.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: ACE’s 1-h, single-exposure edutainment presentation
succeeded in improving students’ knowledge of climate science, positive
engagement in the issue, and climate-related behaviors in the short
term. Knowledge of climate science increased 27 % over baseline levels,
producing an effect size of r=0.50, considered large for social science
(Cohen 1988). Effect sizes were moderate to large (0.42–0.49) for two
measures of positive engagement in the issue of climate change—the
Global Warming’s Six Americas index and self-efficacy for talking about
climate change or starting a conservation project at school. And whereas
fewer than half of students (45 %) recognized before the assembly that
scientists generally agree that global warming is happening, closer to
two-thirds (60 %) recognized this afterward. The behavior most
influenced by the ACE assembly was interpersonal discussion with parents
and with friends about climate change, with small-to-moderate effect
sizes of r=0.23 and 0.25, respectively. We find this encouraging, as it
suggests that students carry the information and enthusiasm they gained
from the edutainment presentation into their families and social
circles. This result also illustrates how discussion of climate change
is a potential game changer for shifting norms, as well as deeper issue
engagement and action (Rimal and Flora 1998).

**Message to keep:**: The authors suggest that using educational and
entertainment tools could be a good strategy to teach CC due to its
engaging benefits, and consider that bringing the discussion within
students and their personal circle ( family or friends) is a useful
mechanism to change norms in a general level.

**title** Arctic Climate Connections Curriculum: A Model for Bringing
Authentic Data Into the Classroom

## 35.1 abstract

Science education can build a bridge between research carried out by
scientists and relevant learning opportunities for students. The Broader
Impact requirements for scientists by funding agencies facilitate this
connection. We propose and test a model curriculum development process
in which scientists, curriculum developers, and classroom educators work
together to scaffold the use of authentic, unprocessed scientific data
for high school students. We outline a three-module curriculum structure
that facilitates these goals. This curriculum engages students in the
collection, description, visualization, and interpretation of data;
develops understanding of the nature of science; includes prompts to
develop higher-order thinking skills; builds knowledge of regional
relevance of climate change in students; uses active learning
techniques; and can be easily integrated with the Next Generation
Science Standards. The curriculum was reviewed and tested in the
classroom. To shed further light on the curriculum development process,
we gathered reflection data from the scientists, curriculum developers,
and educators. Scientists appreciated the collaborative process in which
they contributed their expertise without requiring a large time
commitment or strong expertise in science education. The curriculum
developers viewed the modular structure as helpful in breaking
complicated scientific concepts into teachable steps. Classroom
educators appreciated the detailed description and step-by-step
instructions to navigate data analysis tools like Excel or Google Earth.
Initial classroom implementation of the curriculum by 11 teachers with
over 1,100 students showed high levels of interest in the topic and
engagement. Further work is needed to assess efficacy of the curriculum
through classroom observations and measures of student learning. © 2015

**title** Opinions and Knowledge About Climate Change Science in High
School Students

## 36.1 abstract

This study investigates the influence of knowledge on opinions about
climate change in the emerging adults’ age group (16-17 years).
Furthermore, the effects of a lecture in climate change science on
knowledge and opinions were assessed. A survey was conducted in Austria
and Denmark on 188 students in national and international schools before
and after a lecture in climate change science. The results show that
knowledge about climate change science significantly affects opinions
about climate change. Students with a higher number of correct answers
are more likely to have the opinion that humans are causing climate
change and that both individuals and governments are responsible for
addressing climate change. The lecture in climate change science
significantly improved knowledge development but did not affect
opinions. Knowledge was improved by 11 % after the lecture. However, the
percentage of correct answers was still below 60 % indicating an urgent
need for improving climate change science education.

## 36.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The objective of the study is to investigate the opinions and level of
knowledge about climate change science in high school students from the
emerging adults’ age group, and to investigate how their opinions and
knowledge is affected by a lecture in climate change science.

**Questions**:

NA

## 36.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: A lecture based on a Power Point presentation

**Description**: The teaching method used in this study was a lecture
based on a Power Point presentation with 71 slides covering: – basic
climate change science clearly differentiating between natural and
anthropogenic climate change (48 slides) – best-studied impacts of
climate change (12) – human evidence of climate change (2) – current
socio-political status of global agreement – a list of ‘’green jobs’’ –
an appeal to students to consider their role in the future of climate
change mitigation The power point was visual with simple animations and
diagrams demonstrating how climate change operates within the
atmosphere. Each lecture was allotted 45 min for narration, allowing
approximately 30–40 s for each slide to be shown. After the lecture
students continued their usual courses within their respective
disciplines.

## 36.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre-post questionnaire

**Analysis**: The effects of knowledge, country, school, specialization,
and gender on opinions about climate change were analyzed with logistic
regression and expressed in terms of odds ratios (OR) using the PROC
LOGISTICS procedure of SAS. The effects of the lecture (before
vs. after), country, school, specialization, and gender on the knowledge
about climate change was analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS.
Finally, the effects of the lecture on the opinions about climate change
(change in opinions before vs. after) were analyzed with logistic
regression using the PROC LOGISTICS procedure of SAS.

**Results**: When adjusted for specialization and excluding the effect
of gender therewas a significant effect of specialization on the
percentage of correct answers. - There was no significant change in any
of the opinions about climate change after the lecture compared with
before the lecture.

**Improved?**: There was an improve in knowlesge about climate change
but there was not significant change in student´s opinión.

## 36.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: There was a significant increase of knowledge when the
model was adjusted for student’s specialization. (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: Opinios about Climate Change (*Worked?*: There was no
significant change in any of the opinions about climate change after the
lecture compared with before the lecture. )

## 36.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: - knowledge about climate change increases the
likelihood of having the opinion that climate change is caused by humans
and is the responsibility of both individuals and governments, and that
knowledge can be improved by a lecture in climate change science. -
simple instruction (demonstrating and explaining) in climate change
science, though improving knowledge, is not sufficient to provide a
complete overview of climate change science and, more importantly, does
not adequately cover the interdisciplinary aspects of this subject.

**Message to keep:**: Improving knowledge could therefore be an
important factor toward opinion cultivation, effective policy
development, and social engagement toward climate change adaptation and
mitigation. The traditional methods of knowledge development in formal
education institutions are not sufficient for teaching climate change
and are not, due to the socio-scientific nature of the climate change
issue adequately formulated to encourage rational opinion cultivation.
We need to start expecting our students to think critically and we need
to ensure our students are given precise instruction in climate change
science—covering all the aspects of climate change.

**title** CO2peration – Structuring a 3D interactive digital game to
improve climate literacy in the 12-13-year-old age group

## 37.1 abstract

Preparing students for their future and qualifying them to enter public
life is the essential role of the public-school system. As such, an
understanding of climate science ought to be an essential-and
significant component of that preparation. This research proposes a
novel pathway to teach climate science via a 3D interactive digital game
and examines the potential of 12-13-year olds as a prepatent group for
climate science interventions. After playing a proof-of-concept climate
science game that covers the physical causes and mechanisms of climate
change, 401 students in Austria and Australia were tested with a climate
literacy questionnaire. Our results indicate that climate literacy can
be improved in this age group via the digital game. In addition, we
found further evidence of established climate science ‘knowledge
domains’ in this age group that form a natural ‘increased levels of
complexity’ scaffold that can be used to design curricula such as that
in the digital game. These four ‘knowledge domains’ are (in brief):
Earth in the solar system; gravity and its effect on the atmosphere;
albedo and solar radiation, and; greenhouse gases and their warming
potential.

## 37.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: 3D interactive climate science game

**Description**: The narrative for CO2peration follows the journey of a
photon as it visits the Rocky Planets in search of answers as to why
Earth has liquid water on its surface. After working with friendly
orbital space probes (i.e., Messenger, Magellan, Viking I & II, etc.) to
collect data (e.g., composition of planet/surface temperature
samples/diameter of planet), the photon begins modelling the molecules
that it finds along the way. After reaching Mars, the photon returns to
Earth where it explores the role of albedo on Earth’s global mean
surface temperature (GMST); observing the effect from the Exosphere and
then testing it in an atmospheric-tank simulation (altering all relevant
variables to observe outcomes). Earth’s atmosphere is then investigated
by the photon to understand the role that each of Earth’s atmospheric
layers has in allowing us to understand climate phenomena (e.g.,
research on the International Space Station in the Thermosphere/data
from orbital satellites in the Exosphere) and the role each layer plays
in the protection and maintenance of life (e.g., burning-up of meteors
in the Mesosphere/weather in the troposphere/ozone in the stratosphere)
and other atmospheric phenomena (e.g. auroras). Both game versions were
played in the native language of instruction (English in Australia and
German in Austria) and the game contents were translated by a certified
English-German translator.

## 37.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: A climate Science Questionnaire that involved 19 climate
science questions

**Analysis**: To investigate differences between the PRIOR and POST
results (PRIOR_SCORE & POST_SCORE) and differences in knowledge domains
(e.g., for Knowledge Domain 1: PRIOR_KD1 & POST_KD1) as a measure for
climate literacy we conducted a series of pairedsamples T-tests and a
spearman correlation (IBM Statistics 23.0). The overall analysis
approach: 1. Paired-samples T-test for differences between PRIOR and
POST question scores. 2. Paired-samples T-test between PRIOR and POST
knowledge domains (KDs). 3 Spearman correlation for association between
knowledge domains (KDs).

**Results**: T-test results indicate a significant difference in the
scores between PRIOR questionnaire scores (M =48.45, SD =7.97) and POST
questionnaire scores (M = 53.61, SD ¼ 11.13); t (400) = -9.75, p \<
.001. On average, climate literacy improved by 5.16% after playing the
climate science game ‘CO2peration’. Overall, we see an improvement in
climate literacy between the questionnaires that can be explained, at
least in part, by the treatment of the CO2peration game.

**Improved?**: T-test results indicate a significant difference in the
scores between PRIOR questionnaire scores (M = 48.45, SD = 7.97) and
POST questionnaire scores (M = 53.61, SD = 11.13); t (400) = -9.75, p \<
.001. On average, climate literacy improved by 5.16% after playing the
climate science game ‘CO2peration’.

## 37.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: On most questions, there was an improvement in
participants’ climate science knowledge as measured a week following
completion of the game. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 37.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: - The study demonstrate that early adolescents do
understand important concepts related to climate change and they are
capable of improving their understanding of climate science which
supports previous recommendations to introduce climate science earlier
into the secondary curricula. - For climate literacy, 3D interactive
digital games offer enormous potential as an effective mass
communication tool. Visualising climate change helps learners interpret
complex information in a meaningful and comprehendible way; visually and
dynamically representing processes and mechanisms that may be impossible
to explore in real life

**Message to keep:**: These results support previous research
recommendation for the use of visualisations and game-based
interventions to improve climate literacy. In summary, by giving early
adolescents a thorough background in the physical science basis that
underpins climate science, we may help ensure worldview development is
founded on fact and informed decision-making. Aside from the importance
this approach has to worldview, climate literacy also lays a solid
intellectual foundation in climate science which will provide students
with the tools and understanding they’ll need to address this problem.
By establishing climate change in the realm of science, we provide a
base for meaning-focused coping which will help individuals perceive
climate change as a solvable and mitigatable problem. In this way, we
can prepare them to be intellectually, psychologically and emotionally
equipped to deal with climate change.

**title** Through the eyes of a child: exploring and engaging elementary
students’ climate conceptions through photovoice

## 38.1 abstract

Objectives: The largest Global Climate Strike in history was led and
organized by youth, demonstrating students consider climate change a key
issue impacting their futures. However, researchers know little about
the climate change knowledge and experiences elementary students bring
to the classroom. We aimed to engage and explore elementary students’
ideas about how they see climate change in their everyday lives using a
combination of science and arts-based pedagogies.

**title** Supporting and Understanding Students’ Epistemological
Discourse About Climate Change

## 39.1 abstract

The climate change community has begun to look carefully at how the
public understands, or fails to understand, climate change and the
scientific claims made based on data. This study focuses on how teachers
provide scaffolding that supports students’ understanding of, not only
how climate systems work or the causes and effects of climate change,
but also how we know what we know. Stanford’s Global Climate Change:
Professional Development for K-12 Teachers project provided teacher
professional development on the science of global climate change,
curricular materials, and pedagogical strategies. We conducted an
in-depth study of the classrooms of the participating teachers. Our
results show statistically significant gains from pre- to postassessment
in students’ content knowledge and a shift in their opinions about
climate change. These gains are positively related to the percentage of
students who are engaged and interacting, and negatively related to the
percentage of students who are disengaged. Through classroom
observations and video recordings, we identify how teachers and students
talk about how we know about climate change, and we discuss how that
talk can be enhanced. © 2014 National Association of Geoscience

## 39.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

to enhance students’ knowledge of climate change as well as their
awareness of mitigation and adaptation strategies that address the
effects of climate change.

**Questions**:

1.  What did students learn about climate change and to what extent have
    their opinions shifted after experiencing a climate change
    curriculum?
2.  How do teachers and students talk about how we know about climate
    change? 3. What classroom conditions support such talk?

## 39.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: climate change curriculum

**Description**: Section 1 begins with students distinguishing between
climate and weather, and considering the local impact of sea level rise
due to climate change. This hook provides students the opportunity to
think about their own connection to climate change. Students then learn
about the Earth’s energy budget (Section 2) and greenhouse gases
(Section 3) to understand how excess carbon dioxide, with its ability to
bsorb and reradiate heat, is rapidly changing the climate Section 3 ends
with students looking at sources and sinks of carbon dioxide so that
they realize that climate change is almost certainly caused mostly by
humans. In Sections 4 and 5, students examine the effects of climate
change to both physical and biological systems.

## 39.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: questionario

**Analysis**: participants were given a pre-test and a post-test. a
paired t test on the difference between the pre-test and post-test
results of each participant

**Results**: statistically significant gains from pre- to postassessment
in students’ content knowledge and a shift in their opinions about
climate change. These gains are positively related to the percentage of
students who are engaged and interacting, and negatively related to the
percentage f students who are disengaged.

**Improved?**: conocimiento mejoro

**title** Place-based inter-generational communication on local climate
improves adolescents’ perceptions and willingness to mitigate climate
change

## 40.1 abstract

With the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged to promote strategies
and policies to substantially reduce their carbon emissions. To align
public sentiment with potentially expensive climate mitigation policy,
climate change education is considered an essential tool in tackling
climate change, particularly for the young generation. However, a
general lack of engagement is driven by the perception that climate
change is irrelevant at local and individual scales. Based on a modified
version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, we implemented a new climate
change educational programme, in 12 rural areas of China, where
adolescents communicated with local seniors (aged aeyen 60 years) in
focus groups to discuss local climate over the past decades. Seniors’
memories of extreme climatic events generally were in concordance with
meteorological data. The adolescents’ uncertainty about climate change
exhibited significant change after the programme, followed by concern,
risk perception, and perceived behavioural control. Based on mediation
analysis, the shift in adolescent concern and perceived behavioural
control translated into greater willingness to support climate change
mitigation. Thus, we suggest that climate change education should
emphasize place-based strategies that highlight the relevance of global
climate change through local impacts and individual experiences
vis-a-vis inter-generational communication to promote greater engagement
with climate change.

## 40.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

We introduced $$and evaluated using the Theory of Planned Behaviour$$ a
new educational programme for climate change that included inviting
adolescents to communicate with seniors (aged ≥ 60 years) in focus
groups to discuss the local climate during the past several decades.

**Questions**:

No really questions, but three hypotheses were tested: H1: Climate
change can be observed and perceived by individuals in their own
lifetimes through local extreme weather events; H2: The perceptions
about climate change will improve in adolescents who communicate with
local seniors; H3: The place-based inter-generational communication on
local climate can contribute to the changes in behavioural intention of
mitigation.

## 40.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular, but I have a doubt: “, we
introduced a new educational programme for climate change that included
inviting adolescents to communicate with seniors”

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lesson, intergenerational exchange/discussion

**Description**: 1. a 30-min lecture introducing global climate change
(lecture group + communication group) The lecture was based on heuristic
approaches and included questions, images and video clips. 2. 30-min
communication between adolescents and local seniors on local climate in
focus groups. (communication group) We used a focus group setting for
inter-generational communication in order to avoid skewed individual
biased recall and capture the richness of perceived local information.

## 40.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: The survey $$pre-post$$ included questions related to the
modified model of the TPB $$Theory of Planned Behaviour$$, measuring a
range of perceptions associated with climate change, related behavioural
intentions, and key demographic variables 15 min in-depth interviews
were conducted on two students from each focus group $$complete
treatment group$$, who had higher expressing abilities that could
provided comprehensive explanations beyond “yes” or “no” response as
purposive sampling after the post-tests

**Analysis**: ANOVA for testing intervention groups and control on each
construct, with Tukey HSD post-hoc test, type III sum of square -
multiple mixed linear model regression mitigation intention vs
lecture/communication groups, site as random factor (1: all the
socio-demographic variable, 2: all the changes in perceptual variables,
3: 1+2) - multiple mediation analysis with bias correction bootstrap
$$some kind of path analysis based on the Theory of Planned
Behaviour$$ - thematic content analyses of the post interviews

**Results**: ANOVA AND Mixed linear model\_ - Controlling site as a
random factor, the communication group showed a considerable reduction
in uncertainty, an increase in concern and risk perception regarding
climate change compared with the lecture group. The communication group
also showed a significant increase in perceived behavioural control,
subjective norm, place attachment, and mitigation intention. -The
results of the mixed linear model showed that the changes in concern
could be used to positively predict the changes in intention in model 3
(Table 1). The changes in perceived behavioural control, subjective
norms, and place attachment were also strong predictors of changes in
intention. However, although uncertainty and risk perception improved
significantly after the communication, both failed to explain the
changes in intention. - Demographic variables other than gender were not
significant predictors of intention changes. - Communication experience
also failed to show a significant direct relationship with changes in
intention \[but the Tukey post test show a significant difference
Qualitative - The results of the in-depth interview (N = 72) generally
supported the quantitative analysis. - Increased risk perception was
most frequently mentioned (94.4 %) Result not directly related to our
objectives: - The descriptions of trends and extreme climatic events
from local seniors were generally consistent with local meteorological
data

**Improved?**: All constructs (uncertainty, concern, risk perception,
subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, place attachment and
mitigation intention) showed the highest positive effects from the
“communication” (lecture + intergenerational learning), effect of the
lecture only were generally higher than in the control group, and lower
than the complete intervention. NOTE: the mixed model with site as
random factor does not show a significant effect of the intervention
group on intention, which makes the authors have contradictory
conclusions about it, however the Tukey post test show it, and the
multiple mediation analysis shows also indirect effects through the
theoretical construct

## 40.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Risk perception of local vulnerability to climate
change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - Uncertainty about climate change reality (*Worked?*:
Yes )

**intention**: - Behavioural intention of climate change mitigation
(*Worked?*: Yes/Unclear )

**emotions**: - Place attachment to natural aspects - Concern about
climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: In the Theory of Planned Behaviour, 2 construct are used to
explain the Intentions (subjective norms, the surrounding social
pressure about the intention, and perception of control, the perception
about our capacity to act efficiently). In this study, they are declined
as: - Subjective norm - Perceived behaviour control (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 40.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “This study showed that place-based strategies for
climate change education have considerable potential to render the
abstract concrete for helping adolescents understand global issues.
Emphasizing experience-based interpretation and showing the rele- vance
of global climate change to local impacts and individual experiences by
inter- generational communication makes the invisible process of climate
change visible for engage- ment.”

**Message to keep:**: In China the focus groups with local seniors to
discuss local climate change have a positive effects on all the
constructs (perception) of the Theory of Planned Behaviour toward
mitigation intentions, which in turn is, according to this theory, the
best predictor for behavioural change. This outperform the only lecture
intervention, which is for most of the construct better than the control
group (no intervention). 3 specificities might be worth noting: - the
use of the Theory of Planned Behaviour gives a different but complete
cognitive/attitude vision of CCE - a result may not be directly relevant
to us but important: local senior evaluate well the local climate change
effects, the “non-expert” discussions in intergenerational learning may
be used for CCE! - the mixed model with site as random factor does not
show a significant effect of the intervention group on intention, which
makes the authors have contradictory conclusions about it, however the
Tukey post test show it, and the multiple mediation analysis shows also
indirect effects through the theoretical construct

**title** Designs for learning about climate change as a complex system

## 41.1 abstract

This paper reports on a study in which students used agent-based
computer models to learn about complex systems ideas of relevance to
understanding climate change. The experimental condition used a
Productive Failure (PF) learning design in which ninth grade students
initially worked with agent-based computer models to solve challenge
problems followed by teacher instruction about targeted climate and
complexity ideas. In contrast, the comparison condition employed a
Direct Instruction (DI) learning design in which the teacher instruction
was provided initially, followed by the students working on the same
computer models and challenge problems as the experimental group. The
students in the PF group scored significantly higher on the post-test on
measures of climate and complex systems explanatory knowledge and near
and far knowledge transfer. Theoretical and practical implications of
these findings are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

## 41.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

We conducted a study that contrasted and compared the efficacy of a PF
$$Productive Failure$$ design versus a DI $$Direct Instruction$$ design
to help students deeply learnconceptual knowledge about climate ideas
and complex systems.

**Questions**:

RQ1: Are PF and DI treatment conditions equally effective for students
to learn declarative and explanatory knowledge1 about climate and
complex systems ideas? RQ2: Are PF and DI treatment conditions equally
effective for fostering the ability to use the targeted climate and
complexity knowledge for solving two classes of new, not previously
studied, problems? The first class is near transfer, which is solving
new problems in the same domain (e.g., climate problems or complex
systems problems), and the second class is far transfer, which is
solving new problems in a different domain

## 41.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, computer assisted modeling

**Description**: 6 days: - Pre test - Feedback in dynamic systems.
Climate: global temperature, greenhouse effect, cloud cover. Complex
systems: modeling of the ant foraging model - Emergence. Climate: Wind
and storm model. Complex systems: Birds flocking model - Dynamic
equilibrium. Climate: Carbon cycle model. Complex systems: Wolf-sheep
predation model - Tipping points and positive feedback. Climate: climate
model with water feedback. Complex systems: forest fire model - Post
test For every pedagogical activities, the class correspond to a teacher
lecture (15-20 min), an example of complex system model (15-20 min), and
a climate and complex systems models (10-20 min) In the Productive
Failure treatment, the lecture takes place after complex system modeling
activities, in the Direct Instruction treatment, before the modeling
activity.

## 41.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Qualitative open-ended questions concerning four aspects of
climate and complex system knowledge in a pre-post survey: - declarative
knowledge (simple knowledge about concepts of the climate system) -
explanatory knowledge (explaining climate processes) - near transfer
problem (concerning climate system) - far transfer problem (concerning
complex system in another domain) The answers were coded on a 1-4 scale
describing correctness of knowledge and reasoning, and used in
quantitative analyses

**Analysis**: The students’ performance was assessed with a marking
rubric that consisted of a four-point coding scheme. - two-ways
ANOVA/ANCOVA with follow-up t-test (treatment group + experience of
teachers vs declarative knowledge/explanatory knowledge/near
transfer/far transfer) - qulitative analysis of class observations

**Results**: declarative knowledge scores for the two treatment groups
were statistically equivalent in terms of their respective knowledge
gains from pre- test to post-test and there were no significant teacher
effects. (F(1,105) 1⁄4 1.652, p \> 0.1, h2 p 1⁄4 0.015) - For climate
explanatory knowledge, a two-way ANOVA revealed that there was a
significant main effect of treatment group and a significant main effect
of teacher experience at post-test favored the high experience
teachers. - For complex systems explanatory knowledge, a two-way ANCOVA
found that there was a significant main effect for the experimental
treatment group (F(1,105) 1⁄4 21.126, p \< 0.001, h2 p 1⁄4 0.167): while
the students in each of the groups scored higher with experienced
teachers compared to early career teachers, the PF group scored higher
overall than the DI group. - being in the PF treatment had a significant
positive impact on the near transfer scores compared to the DI
treatment. - being in the experimental PF group and having an
experienced teacher each respectively had a positive influence on far
transfer knowledge test scores, but that there was not a statistically
significant special benefit of having both.

**Improved?**: All aspects (declarative knowledge, explanatory
knowledge), resolution of near transfer and far transfer problems
increased in the 2 pedagogical treatment (there are distincts effect of
the teacher experience and the pedagogical treatments)

## 41.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - correctness in declarative knowledge concerning climate
system (e.g. relating biosphere to carbon cycle) - correctness in
explanatory knowledge concerning climate system (e.g. behaviour of
climate phenomena) - ability to use the complex system ideas to resolve
a near transfer problem concerning the complex climate system (butterfly
effect) (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: - ability to resolve a far transfer problem, using complex
system notions in a different domain (not climate) (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 41.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The Productive Failure pedagogical design (presenting a
problem to the students before the lecture) did not do better than the
Direct Instruction (lecture first) design in terms of declarative
knowledge (simple conceptual knowledge about the climate system), but it
performed better in terms of explanatory knowledge (explaining processes
in the climate system), near transfer problem (concerning the climate
system) resolution and far transfer (in another domain) problems. The
authors note that there are 2 explanations: - social perspective: PF
treatment caused more engagement and more collaboration between students
and with the teachers (more questions) - cognitive perspective: the
lecture after the problem allows to activate cognitive processes of
knowledge assembly and shema abstraction

**Message to keep:**: A very interesting study which shows that
different pedagogical designs with exactly the same activities but a
different perspective (problem resolving before lecture) may have
important effect on the capacity of students to use complex system
concepts to better understand the climate. What is also interesting is
that the author show that this may have effect particularly in the
capacity of understanding complex problem even beyond the only domain of
climate.

**title** Developing a Fine-Grained Learning Progression Framework for
Carbon-Transforming Processes

## 42.1 abstract

Science educators have called for using the learning progression
approach to align curriculum, instruction, and assessment. In line with
this trend, we conducted both assessments and teaching experiments with
students from grades 4 to 12 (717 students participated in the
pre-assessments and 682 students participated in the post-assessments).
The goal of the study is to develop a learning progression framework
that provides effective guidance for curriculum and instruction on
carbon-transforming processes in socio-ecological systems. We conducted
the study in three research cycles. We developed a matter-and-energy
learning progression framework during the first two cycles. This
learning progression framework was used to guide the teaching
intervention in the third research cycle. Clinical interviews and
written assessments were implemented before and after the teaching
intervention. In the process of data analysis, we found that the
matter-and-energy learning progression framework did not provide a
fine-grained depiction of students’ reasoning. Therefore, we developed
the five-practice learning progression framework, and used it to
re-analyze data. Results indicate that the teaching intervention has
helped students to achieve significant learning gains, but it was not
effective enough in helping students achieve the upper anchor of the
learning progression frameworkconstructing sophisticated scientific
explanations. The results also indicate that students tended to rely on
coherent and consistent reasoning to construct explanations. Based on
the findings, we provide instructional suggestions and discuss the
implications for climate change education and learning progression
research.

## 42.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The intervention is on knowledge and the outcome is thought process,
that is, whether students thinking reflect complex patterns. E.g. FROM
Classifying and connecting processes based on perceptions, locations,
and sequence of events TO classifying processes into three classes of
carbon-transforming processes and to connect them in terms of the carbon
cycle and the energy ﬂow.

**Questions**:

1)  Progression: Regarding explaining carbon-transforming processes,
    what achievement levels do students typically experience as they
    progress from upper elementary to high schools?
2)  Cohesion and consistency: (1) To what extent are students’ ideas
    coherently organized in their explanations about one
    socio-ecological context (plant growth, flame burning, etc.)? (2) To
    what extent is students’ reasoning consistent across different
    socio-ecological contexts?

## 42.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: 6 units about carbon-transformig processes

**Description**: 6 units about carbon-transforming processes: Systems
and scale (tools for reasoning Plants Unit Animal Unit Decomposers Unit
Ecosystem Unit Human Energy Systems Unit

## 42.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: NA

**Analysis**: “Used thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) to identify
patterns of students’ explaining practices from the interview and
written data”, developed achievement levels for progress variables of
the five-practice learning progression framework. Then used the
framework as guideline to develop coding rubrics for each interview task
and each written assessment item. THEN used paired samples t-test to
compare students learning gains in pre-post interviews (quantitative
models to measure learning gains, cohesion and consistency.) Used IRT to
analyze written assessments.

**Results**: Authors computed a global score of average gains. A.G. for
Elementary School were 0.481 (Effect Size 0.659), Middles school 0.46
(ES=0.604) and High School 0.6 (ES =0.83). Findings suggest that
highschool students were the ones able to take more advantage of the
learninf framework.

**Improved?**: There were significant learning gains according to the
framework developed by researchers, gaining complexity on scales.
However the ultimate goal (constructing scientific explanations) was not
achieved.

## 42.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: The learning progression framework contains five progress
variables to assess student´s understanding of a science topic. Each
progress variable contains four achievement levels that describe
qualitatively different ways of reasoning when explaining
carbon-transforming processes. The “upper anchor” recognizes that there
are three socio-ecological systems: atmosphere, ecosystems, and human
socio-ecological systems that interact with each other through
carbon-transforming processes. There are three cross cutting core
concepts (matter, energy, and scale) that provide students with ways to
connect knowledge from the various disciplines into a coherent and
scientific view of the world’ (*Worked?*: partially )

## 42.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “These results cannot be generalized to other research
contexts; they suggest that effective curriculum and instruction on
carbon-transforming processes could target students’ intuitive ways of
reasoning, which are specified in the learning progression framework.”
However, given partial success the framework shouls be revised.

**Message to keep:**: NGSS changes sciente teaching to make into a more
inquiry based apprach to try to combine knowledge acquisition with the
practical nature of scientific activity

**title** “It makes me angry. REALLY angry”: exploring emotional
responses to climate change education

## 43.1 abstract

Purpose: Climate change education and the emotional consequences this
topic raises in the classroom has been largely ignored by researchers.
This paper considers the emotional response to climate education in a
primary classroom (age 9-10 years) in England and begins to explore the
emotions that teaching about climate change may raise for both teacher,
researcher and pupil. Design: Part of a long-term ethnographic project
in a school in England. Analysis of c60, 9-10-year olds drawings,
participant observation notes and research diaries. Limitations: This is
a small study-further research with larger numbers, different ages and
in different geographical regions are required with both pupils and
teachers. Practical implications: This work identifies pedagogies that
allow injustices children identify to be explored with emotional
responses being navigated rather than ignored. Such approaches support
wellbeing in the face of growing numbers of young people suffering from
eco-anxiety. © 2021, sowi-online e.V.. All rights reserved.

## 43.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This paper considers the emotional response to climate education in a
primary classroom (age 9-10 years) in England and begins to explore the
emotions that teaching about climate change may raise for both teacher,
researcher and pupil.

**Questions**:

1.What are the emotional responses 9-10-year olds recognize with regard
climate change and climate education? (2.How does an ethnographic
approach add to our understanding of emotions when teaching climate
education?) \[Not extracted

## 43.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, drawings and expression of emotions

**Description**: (The intervention is complex to describe because it is
embedded in a long-term teaching/classroom ethnography project) - before
the described session: “Previous to the lesson about climate change we
had worked with the class on issues that related to this theme, for
example fast fashion which, as an industry, contributes 10% of global
carbon emissions.” and lesson about climate change - described session:
“a session that direcly asked pupils about their feelings regarding
climate change”, where students are the “experts on their own knowledge”
organized as discussions and questions to the children, accompanied with
activities of drawing, and expression of their emotions, in 3 parts: 1.
WHat is climate change and the climate crisis (with drawings) 2. Causes
of the climate change (with help of a “scale” to express feelings) 3.
Solutions :“who or what is going to help us” (with drawings)

## 43.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: “Classroom ethnography”. Qualitative analysis of: - drawing
from the children - discussion around the drawing (the teacher walk
through the class and provoke discussion and explanation on the
drawing - expression of emotion helped by a “scale” where all the
student are expected to place their feelings - research diaries from the
teachers where they write their impressions

**Analysis**: “Classroom ethnography”. Qualitative analysis of: -
drawing from the children - discussion around the drawing (the teacher
walk through the class and provoke discussion and explanation on the
drawing - expression of emotion helped by a “scale” where all the
student are expected to place their feelings - research diaries from the
teachers where they write their impressions

**Results**: Overall results: the children who took part in the planned
climate education lessons experienced a spectrum of emotion. Activity 1
and 2 $$general knowledge and cause of the climate change$$ saw many
usually considered negative emotions being displayed and talked about by
young people - such as anger, sadness and helplessness. Activity three
$$future and solutions$$, saw more positive feelings in the class with
all participants being able to identify ways in which we might mitigate
the consequences of climate change. Children were more hopeful and
happier. On activity 2, the authors also noted a large and shared anger
of the students toward the adults which the students considered as
responsible of climate change

**Improved?**: Overall results: the children who took part in the
planned climate education lessons experienced a spectrum of emotion.
Activity 1 and 2 $$general knowledge and cause of the climate change$$
saw many usually considered negative emotions being displayed and talked

## 43.6 Outcomes

**emotions**: Emotions expressed by the students in activities
concerning: 1. the general knowledge 2. the cause of climate change 3.
the solutions (*Worked?*: Yes, but what do we consider as “working”? )

## 43.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: general knowledge and causes of climate change cause
negative emotions: anger, sadness and helplessness in young student
lessons on solutions cause positive emotion such as hope and happiness

**Message to keep:**: This article is very specific in its methodology
(classroom ethnography) and objectives (emotional responses to climate
change education) in young students (9-10 years). The authors describe
negative emotion to the general knowledge and cause of climate change
and positive one on the topic of solutions for climate change in the
future.

## 44.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of the manual
in increasing the knowledge level of the school children about climate
change and health adaptation.

**Questions**:

NA

## 44.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: A printed manual and classroom discusions

**Description**: The manual contains seven chapters that include
essential knowledge about climate change and health issues, the ‘do’s
and don’ts’ during extreme weather events, and adaptation activities.
The science teacher used the topics in the manual as basis for a weekly
45-minutes classroom discussion

## 44.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: A knowledge questionnaire comprised a set of 30 questions on
various aspects of climate change and health issues and took around 20
minutes to complete.

**Analysis**: They modelled a multivariable linear regression using
percentage of post-intervention test score as the outcome variable under
the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) framework to account for
clustering by school, after adjusting for potential confounders and
pre-intervention test score. We then used exchangeable correlation
structure to adjust for clustering in the GEE model. In the initial
model, we included all variables that were significant at 25% level,
along with the main exposure variable (randomization arm) in the
univariable analysis.

**Results**: The final model revealed that students in the intervention
school obtained 17.42% (95% CI: 14–20, P\<0.001) higher marks in the
post test compared to the control school.

**Improved?**: Health effect of climate change knowledge score increased
almost 2 times from baseline to follow up in the intervention group in
comparison to control group, as per multivariable log-binomial
regression analysis.

## 44.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Questions on adaptation for health and mitigation of
climate change showed a statistically significant increased score in the
intervention group than the control group. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 44.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: As the results suggest, a child-centred adaptation
strategy through school-based intervention can enhance the adaptive
capacity of the future generation in the vulnerable community of South
East Asia, specially in the high-risk context of Bangladesh. The manual
could be scaled up to be provided to all schools in the Least Developed
Country context, for mainstreaming the risk awareness in the education
system and to protect human health from climate change.

**Message to keep:**: Children spend many hours a day in schools, and
schools play a central role in teaching life skills. Health promotion in
schools and preparation of children to be adaptation activists can bring
substantial changes in knowledge, attitude and practices to address
climate change issues and effect risk reduction of adverse health
outcomes. Based on this, the intervention trial showed that a novel
educational intervention providing manuals for school children achieved
a significant increase in the knowledge about climate change and its
relation to current and future health risks, as well as the adaptive
measures.

**title** Enhancing Primary School Students’ Knowledge about Global
Warming and Environmental Attitude Using Climate Change Activities

## 45.1 abstract

Climate change generally and global warming specifically have become a
common feature of the daily news. Due to widespread recognition of the
adverse consequences of climate change on human lives, concerted
societal effort has been taken to address it (e.g. by means of the
science curriculum). This study was designed to test the effect that
child-centred, 5E learning cycle-based climate change activities would
have over more traditional teacher-centred activities on Malaysian Year
5 primary students (11 years). A quasi-experimental design involving a
treatment (n = 55) and a group representing typical teaching method (n =
60) was used to measure the effectiveness of these activities on (a)
increasing children’s knowledge about global warming; (b) changing their
attitudes to be more favourable towards the environment and (c) identify
the relationship between knowledge and attitude that exist in this
study. Statistically significant differences in favour of the treatment
group were detected for both knowledge and environmental attitudes.
Non-significant relationship was identified between knowledge and
attitude in this study. Interviews with randomly selected students from
treatment and comparison groups further underscore these findings.
Implications are discussed.

## 45.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study was designed in the context of primary school education in
Malaysia with the underlying purpose of selecting teaching models that
promote students’ knowledge related to global warming and attitudes
towards the environment

**Questions**:

3 hypotheses: (a) Specially designed student-centred, 5E learning
cycle-based climate change activities increases climate change knowledge
of the students compared to the traditional teacher-centred approach.
(b) Specially designed, 5E learning cycle-based student-centred climate
change activities increases pro-environmental attitudes of the students
compared to the traditional teacher-centred approach. (c) There is a
significant positive relationship between pro-environmental attitudes of
the students from treatment group with their knowledge about climate
change based on the post-test results.

## 45.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, experiences, simulation game

**Description**: Five weeks activities: (a) investigating the effect of
greenhouse gases, (b) the carbon dioxide role play, (c) modelling the
melting of icebergs, (d) modelling the melting of glaciers and (e)
investigation of renewable and non-renewable energy that students use in
their homes. In the control treatment the same topics are presented in
teacher-centered lectures

## 45.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: $$KNOWLEDGE$$ pre-post questionnaires on global warming
adapted from a study in the UK (Taber & Taylor, 2009) - $$AWARENESS$$
attitude toward the environment measured with a questionnaire NEP for
children - $$KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS, INTENTION$$: further insights of
student knowledge and attitudes were obtained through 30 minutes
semi-structured interviews on 10 students $$5 in each group$$

**Analysis**: ANCOVA approach was used (Shadish et al., 2002) where the
pretest comparison within-group variance based on pre-experiment
differences To control experiment-wise error rates (i.e. error rates for
the study as a whole), Bonferroni adjustments were used to test each
hypothesis at the corresponding aadj 1⁄4 aexp/3 levels Qualitative
analyses are conducted but there is no described methodological
framework

**Results**: Quantitative: - The first hypothesis stated that there
would be no significant difference in understanding about global warming
between treatment and comparison treatment groups as measured by global
warming test. This hypothesis was (as presented in Table 2) rejected
(F(1, 112) 1⁄4 193.6, p , .00033). The treatment group (M exp 1⁄4 17.07,
SD exp 1⁄4 2.54) outperformed the comparison group (Mcont 1⁄4 9.50,
SDcont 1⁄4 2.75), suggesting that they were more knowledgeable about
global warming. - The second hypothesis stated that there would be no
significant difference between treatment and comparison groups in the
attitude towards the environment as measured by the NEP Scale for
Children. This hypothesis (as presented in Table 2) was rejected (F(1,
112) 1⁄4 7.52, p , .0167). The treatment group exhibited more
pro-environmental attitudes (Mexp 1⁄4 35.27, SDexp 1⁄4 4.66) than the
comparison group (Mcont 1⁄4 32.9, SDcont 1⁄4 4.29) - The third
hypothesis states that there would be no significant correlation between
pro-environmental attitude and knowledge about global warming of the
treatment group students based on the post-test results. This null
hypothesis was not rejected at the chosen a-levels (r(53) 1⁄4 0.285; p
1⁄4 .035) suggesting that there was no significant correlation between
understanding about global warming and pro-environmental attitude.
Qualitative: - $$Contrary to students in the control group$$ The
students in the treatment group provided brief, but specific and
knowledgeable responses. When asked about the causes for global warming,
the treatment students showed that two weeks after the unit, they made
appropriate connections - Consistent with the quantitative results,
students in the treatment group expressed more pro-environmental
attitudes. Compared to the students from the comparison group, the
interview responses reflected somewhat more positive attitudes together
with self-reported changes in pro-environmental behaviours

**Improved?**: The treatment group $$constructivist 5E method$$ had
better results in term of knowledge of climate change, attitude
$$AWARENESS$$ toward environment and attitude $$INTENTION$$ regarding
energy use

## 45.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness in a knowledge based test on global warming
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Attitude toward environment from the NEP scale for
children (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: “Attitudes toward the environment” measured in pre-post
qualitative interviews \[question such as the willingness to turn off
electrical devices after use (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 45.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The 5E pedagogical method (constructivist) is more
efficient for students to gain knowledge, and change attitudes
$$AWARENESS, INTENTION$$ than the classical teacher-centered lessons.
However, no clear correlation between knowledge and attitudes is found
when the results from all the students is mixed

**Message to keep:**: In this study, traditional teacher-centered
lessons are compared to 5E constructivist methods based on students
activities, and the latter seem to have a clearly more efficient effect
on knowledge, awareness and intentions of the students. It might be
worth noting that the researchers insist on the fact that in the
malaysian education, it goes opposite to the traditional exam-focused
education. Moreover there was no overall (without considering treatment)
correlation between knowledge and attitudes.

**title** Remediating misconception on climate change among secondary
school students in Malaysia

## 46.1 abstract

Existing studies report on secondary school students’ misconceptions
related to climate change; they also report on the methods of teaching
as reinforcing misconceptions. This quasi-experimental study was
designed to test the null hypothesis that a curriculum based on
constructivist principles does not lead to greater understanding and
fewer misconceptions on acid rain, global warming, greenhouse effect,
and ozone layer depletion than the traditional Malaysian curriculum. For
this purpose, two classes from two different schools were randomly
assigned to experimental (N = 35) and control condition (N = 38).
Following the intervention, an ANCOVA with pre-test as the covariate
showed statistically significant differences in understanding for all
four topics; additional interviews with randomly selected students from
experimental and control group further underscore the findings.
Implications are discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

## 46.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The present study was designed to test whether students, taught by means
of a curriculum grounded in a constructivist epistemology and with
materials adopted from sources such as the United Nations Framework
Convention (1992) (experimental treatment) would lead to better
understandings of climate change-related concepts among Malaysian high
school students than the regular, state-mandated curriculum (control
treatment).

**Questions**:

Test of the null hypothesis comparing student understanding of climate
change-related concepts when taught using an experimental vs.
traditional curriculum.

## 46.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Conceptual change approach

**Description**: The experimental group was instructed using four foci:
acid rain, greenhouse effect, global warming, and ozone layer depletion.
Students were asked to perform the activities in groups of five followed
by an in-group discussion. The entire set of activities was conducted
over a five-week period (one activity per week). The activities included
role-play, hands-on laboratories, and a video exploring the ozone layer.
The control group conducted activities on the same topic over a
five-week period (one activity per week for 2 h). These followed a
traditional teacher-centered lecture format with students listening,
discussing in groups, and presentation of the outcome of discussion.

## 46.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Questionnaires and interviews

**Analysis**: Pre-test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)

**Results**: The experimental treatment group (Mexp = 1.51, SDexp =
0.56) outperformed the control group (Mcont = 0.97, SDcont = 0.55),
suggesting that they better understood the central concepts of this
dimension of climate change. Students in the experimental group
exhibited better understanding of global warming concepts (Mexp = 3.29,
SDexp = 0.86) than their peers in the control group (Mcont = 2.03,
SDcont = 1.15). On average, students in the experimental group exhibited
better understandings as measured by the AREPDiT subtest (Mexp = 3.17,
SDexp = 0.82) than the students of the control group (Mcont = 1.84,
SDcont = 0.89). The experimental group (Mexp = 2.46, SDexp = 0.85)
outperformed the control group (Mcont = 1.68, SDcont = 0.93) on the
understanding of acid rain concepts as measured by the related AREPDiT
subtest.

**Improved?**: Improved understandings and fewer misconceptions about
global warming, greenhouse effects, acid rain, and ozone layer
depletion.

## 46.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Better understandings of climate change-related concepts
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 46.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: Alternative curriculums are useful to strike the
misconceptions on climate change, and it is helpful to support this type
of learning throw role-play, hands-on laboratories, and video. The
results in general shown differences between the traditional curricula
and the curriculim based on constructivis approach.

**title** Experiential-based climate change education: fostering
students’ knowledge and motivation towards the environment

## 47.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most important environmental issues
affecting our society today and we need to educate the citizens about
the impact on human lives. An attempt was made to integrate
experiential-based climate change education into the teaching and
learning of secondary school Biology lessons on the topic of Endangered
Ecosystem to improve students’ knowledge on climate change and increase
motivation towards caring for the environment. Two classes from a school
were randomly assigned to experimental (N = 30) and control groups (N =
32). Following the intervention, a one-way analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) with pre-test data as covariate showed statistically
significant differences in knowledge and motivation. Experiential-based
climate change activities enabled students to construct the knowledge
socially and also satisfied the three basic human needs: competence,
autonomy and relatedness, which have subsequently promoted motivation.
The findings described in this study are similar with other studies
which reported that constructivist-based experiential learning has
successfully developed awareness and encouraged learning and critical
thinking about climate change. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as

## 47.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study attempts to integrate experiential-based climate change
activities into the teaching and learning of Form Four Biology lessons
on “Endangered Ecosystems.” The effectiveness of this intervention to
improve students’ knowledge on climate change and their motivation was
measured

**Questions**:

NA

## 47.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lessons, Field trip, discussions, videos, Carbon footprint
calculation, role game discussion.

**Description**: Experimental treatment, during each activity students
go through 4 stages of learning: concrete experience; reflective
observation; abstract con- ceptualization; and active experimentation. -
first week: field trip to Penang National Park, observation, photos,
comparison with close city Georgetown) - second lesson: video about
climate change and discussion, analysis of global climate change data -
third lesson: interactive presentation regarding greenhouse effect,
experiments with plastic bottles (temperature) - fourth lesson: climate
change in local and global community, climate change card game, lessons
on climate change effect - fifth lesson: carbon footprint calculation -
sixth lesson: role playing (minister, architect, teacher, doctor,
student, farmer, businessman, environmentalist, town planner and
policeman) Each group had to discuss and present how they could reduce
the impact of climate change globally and locally. Control treatment: In
the control group, the students were taught about climate change and how
climate change endangered our ecosystem as presented in the Form Four
Biology curriculum specifications (CDC, 2006), using their Ministry of
Education certified textbooks. During the lessons, the teacher used the
chalk and talk method to teach the entire topic on climate change.

## 47.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Climate Change Knowledge Test (CCKT): The CCKT, Shepardson,
Niyogi, Choi, and Charusombat (2009), was used to measure students’
knowledge about climate change. The test consisted of five items: four
open-response items and one-draw-and-explain item that tested the
students’ knowledge related to climate change. Motivation Toward the
Environment Scale (MTES) The MTES obtained from Pelletier et al. (1998)
was used to measure students’ motivation towards environment. The MTES
consisted of 24 items with six subscales: intrinsic motivation,
integrated regulation, identified regulation, introjected regulation,
external regulation, and amotivation. Each subscale consisted of four
items.

**Analysis**: The scores obtained from pre-test and post-test were
analyzed using one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) Data collected
from this study were analyzed and the level of significance was set at
0.05 (p\< 0.05) similar to other studies on climate change

**Results**: Knowledge: - both groups exhibited an increase in the
minimum and maximum scores. However, it is observed that the increase in
the experimental group was higher than the control group. The mean
post-test score of the experimental group was also higher than the
average (Mexp = 9.66; SD exp = 1.66). - there was a significant effect
(F(1,59) = 88.30, p \< 0.05) of experiential-based climate change
education on the students’ knowledge about climate change after
controlling the pre-test scores. The partial eta-squared value of 0.599
indicates that 59.9% of changes in the post-test were caused by the
treatment. Motivation toward the environment: - In the post-test from
the results in Table 5, it is clear that the students in the
experimental group exhibited higher mean values for the first three
motivations: intrinsic, integrated and identified compared to the
control group. For th the experimental group displayed higher increase
than the control group students did. This suggests that the treatment
received by the experimental group students resulted in the students
having more pro-environmental motivation than the control group students
do.e other three subscales, introjected, external and amotivation, both
groups exhibited lower mean scores. This shows that they improved on
these three subscales. -

**Improved?**: Both groups have increased their knowledge and moved
toward intrinsic motivation toward the environment. However the increase
is greater for the experimental group (experiential based with
constructivist bases).

## 47.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness in the Climate Change Knowledge Test
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**emotions**: Measurement of motivation Toward the environment scale.
The scale measure whether the motivation is
intrinsic\>integrated\>identified\>introjected\>external\>amotivation.
The idea is that people having more self motivation is more likely to
act than people having an extrinsic motivation (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 47.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Experiential based constructivist pedagogy is more
efficient for knowledge gain and creating a more intrisic motivation
toward the environment.

**Message to keep:**: An experimental study with an experimental and a
control group which shows that the experiential based contructivist
method is more efficient for knowledge gains and to create a more
intrinsic/personal motivation toward environment. This more intrinsic
motivation is expected to be more likely to push toward action. The
authors insist on the special role of the local field trip in the
experimental group which makes students more “touched” by the local
ecosystem and the consequences of climate change

**title** Changing Climate Change Education. Exploring moderate
constructivist and transdisciplinary approaches through the
research-education co-operation k.i.d.Z.21

## 48.1 abstract

The COP21 Agreement 2015 sets very high targets, which cannot be reached
by political agreements or technological progress alone. Within this
context, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), and particularly
Climate Change Education (CCE), play an ever increasing role regarding a
holistic societal transformation towards a sustainable world. Creating
ESD/CCE learning settings and delivering scientific evidence for their
success has turned into a vital challenge in order to meet the high
expectations. In this longitudinal study, based on the research project
k.i.d.Z.21 - Competent into the Future, we deliver scientific evidence
of the success of CCE when based on transdisciplinary and/or moderate
constructivist theories, and show that the impact is even higher when
both approaches are combined. The data presented derive from scientific
surveys and tests, involving 343 teenagers before and after intensive
collaboration with a high number of experts, including renowned climate
change scientists.

## 48.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study aims to provide scientifically reproducible evidence of the
comparable success of the various educational modules of k.i.d.Z.21,
when delivered in three ways: in line with moderate constructivist
theories, in line with transdisciplinary theories, and, thirdly,
delivered via a combination of both theories.

**Questions**:

- does the project k.i.d.Z.21 raise the young participants’ preparedness
  for CC and its consequences?
- Do they find that moderate constructivist theory and transdisciplinary
  theory when practised in CCE settings play vital roles in enhancing
  their deeper understanding of CC and its consequences?
- Is there an even greater impact on the participants’ learning
  experience by combining both moderate constructivist and
  transdisciplinary approaches?
- Are the teenagers able to produce detailed responses regarding their
  CCE experiences?

## 48.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular/Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lessons,Seminaries,Research projects,Field trip

**Description**: k.i.d.Z.21 is a one-year multi-module programme, the
interventions analysed here are: - classical school lessons on CC -
every student’s two individual CC research projects - lectures,
workshop + debates with CC experts - CC research students + CC experts
in high Alpine settings (one-week excursion)

## 48.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-post questionnaire - teacher online survey - structured
interviews with the head teachers - pencil and paper survey completed by
students

**Analysis**: Quantitative: - T-Test for dependent samples on self
reported gain in preparedness - Anova with Games-Howel post-hoc test on
Likert scale data - Nominal data analysed with chi-square tests
Qualitative: - follows a deductive approach on a theoretically
depveloped set of categories reliability of the pre-post tests with
Holsti and randomly adjusted coefficient of Krippendorff’s alpha

**Results**: General result: raise in preparedness for CC and its
consequences $$KNOWLEDGE$$ - students rated themselves: pre- 51%, post-
75%, significative chi-squared test - t-test show also a significative
increase on the same data Comparing educative approach: - all of the
innovative approach es are rated to convey a much better understanding
than classical school lessons (ANOVA, p\<0.001; post-hoc tests, all p
values\<0.001) - the module classical school lessons on CC is given the
highest rating 1 by only five percent of participating students, whereas
both the modules lectures, workshops + debates with CC experts (19
percent), and every student’s two individual CC research projects (21
percent) are rated approximately four times higher. - Combining
transdisciplinary and moderate constructivist approaches, the module CC
research students + CC experts in high Alpine setting shows the most
profound influence on CC understanding (33 percent) compared to the
other modules (Chi square test, p\< 0.001)

- classical school lessons take two thirds of the project time per
  student per year (66.6 percent,100 h/150 h), but they are awarded less
  than three percent of the overall positive codings affirming learning
  by the students.
- two thirds of the codings affirming learning appear to be achieved in
  little more than ten percent of the project time in a combined
  transdisciplinary and moderate constructivist approach.

**Improved?**: Self-reported knowledge increased and students identified
the approaches combining moderate constructivist and transdisciplinary
approaches as the most helpful for this raise.

## 48.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Self reported preparedness for CC and its
consequences - how each module helped understand CC and its consequences
(self-reported) (*Worked?*: Yes in the follow up but back at baseline in
)

## 48.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: - Overall the k.i.d.Z.21 have a very positive effect on
the self-reported preparedness $$KNOWLEDGE$$ for CC and its
consequences - both innovative approach (moderate constructivism and
transdisciplinary approaches) are reported as more useful than
traditional school lessons - Combining moderate constructivism and
transdisciplinary approaches is the most useful reported approach

**Message to keep:**: This is another k.i.d.Z.21 study which show great
results in raising (self-reported) knowledge of the students. When
modules are compared, the ones following innovative pedagogical approach
(moderate constrictivism or transdisciplinary approach are perceived as
performing better, and combining them show even greater results.

**title** A culturally relevant teacher professional development for
Teaching climate change to Native American Students

## 49.1 abstract

The science of climate change is a complex subject to teach. Teachers
find climate change a challenging topic to teach due to a myriad of
reasons. Gayford, 2010 describes some of the challenges teachers face
while teaching climate change science as “first, the controversial
nature of the topic; second, it does not relate well to the normal
sequencing and division of topics within most science courses; and,
third, there are important non-scientific aspects to possible solutions
to the problem” (p.1191). This is a particular challenge for teachers
with a diverse population. This paper reports on teachers’ understanding
of climate change science concepts and how to teach science with a focus
on cultural relevance by participating in a three-year teacher
profession development program specifically for science teachers
teaching a large population of Native American students. Overall
teachers demonstrated gains in understanding of how scientists access
data to study climate impacts and how to present climate change science
concepts that tap into culturally relevant ways.

## 49.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: Teachers are in need of a better understanding of
how to interpret the data related to climate change. It is not uncommon
for teachers in the secondary school systems to avoid this topic because
of its political baggage and their lack of familiarity with the relevant
science. Bringing Indigenous knowledge into the classroom to teach
science is challenging for the teachers (lack of confidence, of contact,
of ability to build partnerships).

**title** Unpacking the power of place-based education in climate change
communication

## 50.1 abstract

Climate change is the one of the most controversial issues in
environmental history since natural processes and human activities lead
to causation. This complexity often thwarts communication and education
efforts. Some research suggests that place-based approaches are
effective for delivering climate change instruction because they feature
local and observable impacts, thus connecting human behavior with
climate change. This study developed and evaluated the efficacy of a
place-based climate change education program using a one-group, pre and
posttest design. The study involved 29 high-school students who
participated in a one-week, summer education program at Prairie Fork
Conservation Area in mid-Missouri. Use of place-based education was
hypothesized to promote knowledge, awareness, responsibility, hope, and
behavioral intention of participants regarding climate change. Results
suggested that the program was an effective way to increase
understanding of climate change, as evidenced by significant increases
in a variety of measures. Implications for using place-based education
are discussed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

## 50.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

to evaluated the efficacy of a place-based climate change education
program

**Questions**:

“(1) To what extent does the program influence participants’ knowledge,
awareness, sense of responsibility and sense of hope concerning CC? (2)
To what extent does the program influence participants’ intention
performing more climate friendly behavior? (3) What are participants’
perceptions regarding a place-based CC education toolkit?”

## 50.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: climate change toolkit

**Description**: Introduction: A poster was created that defined CC, how
it works, its causes (individual activities that accelerate change), the
impacts in Missouri, and some ways to become more climate friendly. II.
Guided hike: A guided hike was adapted from “Southern Forest and Climate
Change Activity 1: stepping through the climate science” (Monroe &
Oxarart, 2014). During the hike, participants learned about some
evidence of CC in Missouri and how to identify it. III. Self reflection:
The third item in the toolkit was a “score card.” These cards consisted
of list of activities that reduce the impact of CC at home and other
local contexts, such as parks. It also listed a series of climate
friendly activities and a self-scoring rubric (0 1⁄4 never, 1 1⁄4
sometimes, 2 1⁄4 always). Based on the sum score (from 0 to 32), a
reccommendation was provided: 0-12: try harder, 13-24 1⁄4 on the right
track, and 25-32 1⁄4 keep it up.

## 50.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: questionario

**Analysis**: The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 25.
Percentages, means, standard deviations, and frequency distributions
were calculated on demo- graphics and the perceptions of the toolkit.

**Results**: students showed significant increases in level of knowledge
regarding CC (t 1⁄4 8.72, df 1⁄4 28, p \<.001), awareness of CC (t 1⁄4
6.64, df 1⁄4 28, p \< 0.001), sense of responsibility regarding CC (t
1⁄4 1.83, df 1⁄4 28, p 1⁄4 04), sense of hope regarding CC (t 1⁄4 1.62,
df 1⁄4 28, p 1⁄4 .05), and behavioral intention (t 1⁄4 1.43, df 1⁄4 28,
p 1⁄4 .08).

**Improved?**: conocimiento mejoro

**title** Using Rain Gardens to Promote Service Learning and Climate
Science Education with Urban Youth

## 51.1 abstract

The Jersey Roots, Global Reach 4-H Climate Science Program conducted in
Camden, New Jersey introduces middle school students to the evidence,
impacts, and potential solutions to climate change. For their service
learning project, students installed two rain gardens at the school.
Rain gardens are shallow landscaped depressions in the soil that can be
installed at homes, parks, and schools and provide environmental
benefits by filtrating stormwater runoff. Created using native plants,
rain gardens are aesthetically pleasing and require minimal maintenance.

**title** Multi‐level Assessment of Scientific Content Knowledge Gains
Associated with Socioscientific Issues‐based Instruction

## 52.1 abstract

This study explored the impact of using a socioscientific issue (SSI)
based curriculum on developing science content knowledge. Using a
multi-level assessment design, student content knowledge gains were
measured before and after implementation of a three-week unit on global
warming (a prominent SSI) that explored both the relevant science
content and the controversy surrounding global warming. Measures of
student content knowledge were made using a standards-aligned content
knowledge exam (distal assessment) and a curriculum-aligned exam
(proximal assessment). Data were collected from 108 students enrolled
from two schools. Quantitative analysis of the distal assessment
indicated that student post-test scores were statistically significantly
different than their pre-test scores (F = 15.31, p\<0.001). Qualitative
analyses of student responses from the proximal assessment indicated
that students, on average, expressed more accurate, more detailed, and
more sophisticated understandings of global warming, the greenhouse
effect, and the controversy and challenges associated with these issues
following the three-week unit. Combined results from the proximal and
distal assessments explored in this study offer important evidence in
supporting the efficacy of using SSI as contexts for science education.
In addition to a discussion of the components of an SSI-based
curriculum, this study provides support for the use of SSI as a context
for learning science content. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

gains using both curriculum-aligned and standards-aligned assessments.

**Questions**:

NA

## 52.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Three-week unit on global warming

**Description**: The three-week unit consisted of seven learning
exercises across approximately 15 contact hours. The first of the seven
exercises required students to identify their own personal reactions to
global warming following discussions of global warming in the news. The
second exercise highlighted the sociopolitical complexity of global
warming. The next three portions of the intervention provided
opportunities to explore the basic concepts underlying the science of
global warming through three consecutive laboratory exercises. In the
sixth exercise, students considered climate data and displays produced
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For the
culminating activity, students worked in pairs to develop a national
policy related to global climate change.

## 52.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Two instruments, Standards-aligned Test and Curriculum-aligned
Test

**Analysis**: Analysis of standards-aligned pre- and post-test scores
was conducted using a repeated measures ANOVA and qualitative analysis.

**Results**: The average gains for the ES class was 1.88, and for CH was
1.294 (total score = 20; see Figure 1). The results of the analysis
indicate that student post-test scores were statistically significantly
different than their pre-test scores (F = 15.31, p \< 0.001). There was
no evidence of an interaction effect between the time variable (pre and
post) and course variable suggesting that the intervention produced
similar effects in both classroom settings (F = 2.88, p = 0.094).

**Improved?**: The students gained more knowledge about global warning
and expressed more accurate, more detailed, and more sophisticated
understandings of global warming, the greenhouse effect, and the
controversy and challenges associated with these issues.

## 52.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Knowledge gains on global warning and its controversy
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 52.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: The introduction of Socioscientific Issues (SSI)
could be a beneficial pedagogic strategy in the learning process. In
this study, the results shown that students gains knowlege on global
warming and other related topics.

**title** What Triggers Climate Action: The Impact of a Climate Change
Education Program on Students’ Climate Literacy and Their Willingness to
Act

## 53.1 abstract

There has been an intensive debate in the field of climate change
education about what predictors influence youth’s climate-related
behavior and what educational strategies and practices stimulate such
behavior. This study investigated the impact of the ‘CO2 League’ program
which involved 47 schools (N = 123). For the analyses, we used
pre-/-post quasi-experimental design which combined quantitative and
qualitative methods: an extensive pre-/-post survey for analyzing
several components of students’ climate literacy
(system/action/effectiveness knowledge, climate change concern,
self-efficacy, willingness for climate-protective behavior) and focus
group interviews. The analyses revealed a significant impact of
sufficient climate change knowledge on climate change concern which
subsequently positively influenced participants’ self-efficacy and their
willingness to act. The findings of this study suggest that knowledge is
a key initial driver for climate action, especially for young people,
and confirm the conclusion of previous studies that willingness to adopt
pro-climatic behavior presupposes a clear and explicit understanding of
climate dynamics and its causal relations. The focus group interviews
also revealed that the reported increased willingness to act often
translated into actual climate action and that learning about the
concept of carbon footprint and the process of calculating and
decreasing it proved to be a very accessible and fast path to
participants’ engagement in personal climate action.

**title** (Climate) Change in young people’s minds – From categories
towards interconnections between the anthroposphere and natural sphere

## 54.1 abstract

The grand challenges of the 21st century will increasingly require
societies to reconsider the pathways taken thus far. Engagement with
climate change is of ever-growing importance to young people. They will
be confronted with the effects of climate change throughout their entire
lives and, as future decision-makers,they will vitally shape societal
developments. Education will thus play a crucial role in the
transformation to a sustainable society. In terms of awareness-raising,
an important first step in preparing young people for the challenges of
the 21st century is to understand what content is connected with climate
change. As complex challenges, such as climate change, demand ways of
thinking that go beyond categories, interconnections between the
anthroposphere and the natural sphere have to be taken into
consideration. This study provides an insight into the questions and
topics young people develop whilst becoming involved in climate change
in an in-school learning setting and in an out-of-school learning
setting (a high mountain environment). The analysis focuses on the
question of in which spheres students predominantly make their thematic
choices and how far the interconnections between different spheres are
formed. Our results show that the choice of the learning setting
influences the topics students connect with climate change.
Interconnections between sub-spheres of the anthroposphere and natural
sphere are made only occasionally. These findings serve as a basis for
reconsidering the content and foundation of climate change communication
with young people. We recommend that climate change educational
programmes should include phases that allow the following: a)
involvement with climate change issues related to single spheres in the
first phase, and b) consideration of the interconnections between
spheres when becoming involved with climate change issues in the second
phase. As the educational setting can considerably influence the focus
of the teaming process, it should be chosen thoughtfully. (C) 2016

## 54.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The objective of the study presented herein is to investigate how far
interconnections between the natural sphere and the anthroposphere are
recognised by teenagers when becoming involved with the issue of climate
change. Our goal is to go beyond the consideration of students with a
focus on the natural sphere, and rather analyse their ideas with regard
to the complexity of global climate change.

**Questions**:

1.  what content teenagers connect with, as regards the issue of climate
    change?
2.  How far the teenagers build an interconnection between different
    spheres is investigated?

## 54.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: both

**Type**: Educational activities

**Description**: 2 phases: 1. The first one is an in-school learning
setting that allows an interdisciplinary learning process and applies
the theory of moderate constructivism. 2. It is an out-of-school
learning setting, which also encompasses the criteria described above.
The decisive difference compared to the first setting, however, is that
the students are out of their everyday school environment and confronted
with an authentic high mountain environment.

## 54.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test / post-test

**Analysis**: participants were given a pre-test and a post-test. a
paired t test on the difference between the pre-test and post-test
results of each participant

**Results**: Results show that the choice of the learning setting
influences the topics students connect with climate change.
Interconnections between sub-spheres of the anthroposphere and natural
sphere are made only occasionally. These findings serve as a basis for
reconsidering the content and foundation of climate change communication
with young people. W

**Improved?**: better understanding and more awareness

## 54.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: yes (*Worked?*: yes )

**awareness**: yes (*Worked?*: yes )

## 54.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: They recommend that climate change educational
programmes should include phases that allow the following: a)
involvement with climate change issues related to single spheres in the
first phase, and b) consideration of the interconnections between
spheres when becoming involved with climate change issues in the second
phase. As the educational setting can considerably influence the focus
of the learning process, it should be chosen thoughtfully

**Message to keep:**: The findings encourage reflection upon the
formulation of the climate change educational programmes followed so
far, but also of educational programmes in general where the physical
environment or human-environmental interconnections are relevant.
Approaches and content that support more connected thinking are
recommended. For the development of such strategies, further research on
the content considered relevant by teenagers will be necessary

**title** International Peer Collaboration to Learn about Global Climate
Changes

## 55.1 abstract

Climate change is not local; it is global. This means that many
environmental issues related to climate change are not geographically
limited and hence concern humans in more than one location. There is a
growing body of research indicating that today’s increased climate
change is caused by human activities and our modern lifestyle.
Consequently, climate change awareness and attention from the entire
world’s population needs to be a global priority and we need to work
collaboratively to attain a sustainable future. A powerful tool in this
process is to develop an understanding of climate change through
education. Recognizing this, climate change has been included in many
science curricula as a part of science education in schools. However,
teaching such a complex and global topic as climate change is not easy.
The research in this paper has been driven by this challenge. In this
paper, we will present our online science module called Global Climate
Exchange, designed with inquiry activities for international peer
collaboration to teach climate change. In this study, we engaged 157
students from four countries (Canada, China, Sweden, and Norway) to
collaborate in Global Climate Exchange. To explore the opportunities
that international peer collaboration in Global Climate Exchange gives,
we have analyzed how students develop their explanations about climate
change issues over time. Our analysis showed that the students increased
the proportion of relevant scientific concepts in relation to the total
number of words in their explanations and that they improved the quality
of links between concepts over a six-week period. The analysis also
revealed that the students explained more perspectives relating to
climate change issues over time. The outcomes indicate that
international peer collaboration, if successfully supported, can be an
effective approach to climate change education. © 2015 by iSER,

## 55.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To explore the opportunities that international peer collaboration in
Global Climate Exchange gives $$internet platform, base of the
intervention$$, we have analyzed how students develop their explanations
about climate change issues over time

**Questions**:

- How do students develop their explanations about climate change issues
  over time when participating in Global Climate Exchange?
- Is the development of the students’ explanations of climate change
  issues correlated to how the students interact with their peers?

## 55.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular \[supported by teachers, it might even
be part of the study plan, but that is not clear in the paper

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Wiki redaction, discussions on internet

**Description**: “We have developed a science module $$on an internet
platform$$ called Global Climate Exchange. In Global Climate Exchange,
students collaborate with their peers from other countries $$here:
Norway (only ones analysed), China, Sweden, Canada$$ in online
inquiry-based activities. The module was designed as a scaffolding wiki,
in other words, as an online knowledge community where students were
scaffolded through activities, by tasks given by the designers and the
teachers, to explore and discuss climate change issues. In Global
Climate Exchange, students were guided to collaborate with their peers
through four different activities: Brainstorm activity, Issue activity,
Discussion activity, and Chat activity, during a 6-week period -
Brainstorm activity: During the first week, the students worked on the
brainstorm activity, where they identified national climate change
issues, added these to a Google Map developed specifically for this
activity, and described the issues on a brainstorm page. Through this
activity, the students started to communicate national and local climate
change issues to their peers. After finishing this activity, the
students’ work was examined by teachers and researchers to identify
global issues that were relevant for further elaboration in the
subsequent activities - Issue activity : After the brainstorm activity,
each student was assigned to one of the twelve climate change issues,
building groups containing students from different countries. The
students’ task was, in collaboration, to investigate and describe their
climate change issue further; more specifically, they were asked to
describe the issue, give relevant examples from their own countries, and
explain the science related to the issue. - Discussion activity: Still
working in their groups from the issue activity, the students were
introduced to a discussion activity. The discussions were initiated by
questions posed by the designers and teachers about climate change
topics:”What is ‘Global’ in Global Climate Change?“,”How can changes in
your lifestyle improve climate change?“,”What could be done?“,”What has
been done?“, and”What might happen if we do nothing?” - Chat activity:
Embedded in Global Climate Exchange there was also the option for
students to, at any time, create a chat room. There was no guidance
provided for the use of chat rooms in Global Climate Exchange, except
for some ethical rules, which were monitored by researchers and teachers
in each country.

## 55.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Using the usernames of the students, the author extracted all
the content from the wiki platforms and analysed them (see analyses for
the identification and coding of categories), they also extracted
(number indicators) the activity and interactions of the students in the
platform.

**Analysis**: There is no real complex analyses used, however, the
identification and coding of the qualitative data is very structured:
“The analyses were conducted in following three steps. In the first
step, scientific concepts, links, and perspectives in students’ written
explanations were identified and coded. Secondly, after students’
explanations were categorized into concepts and links, they were
converted into concept maps. This coding included an organization of the
explanations in terms of how coherent the explanations were and the
relevance of different parts fitting the explanation as a whole. In this
step, explanations of cause and effect relationships were evaluated. The
categorizations of explanations are based on the taxonomy of Causal
Models and the SOLO taxonomy. To answer the second research question,
the developments of students’ explanations of climate change issues were
correlated with how the students interacted with peer students’ online
activities.

**Results**: Use of concepts: The results show that the proportion of
relevant scientific concepts in relation to the total number of words
used in the explanation increased on average from 0.16 in the first week
to 0.20 in the last week. The proportion of concepts that the students
used in their explanations varied from 0.12 to 0.36 between students,
whereas there was less variation within each student’s explanation over
time. The greatest difference was between the students’ use of concepts
in the first week (SD = 0.13), which declined to 0.8 in week 2, and then
to 0.6 from week 3 to week 6. - Link quality between concepts: The first
week had links in students’ explanations that were dominated by low
quality: weak/irrelevant/misunderstood. The proportion of low quality
links decreased in the third week and remained stable until week 6. -
Variety of perspectives on the studied issues: Six perspectives were
identified in the students’ initial explanations: cause, evidence,
mechanism, predicted consequence, remediation, and adaptation. In the
first week, students focused mostly on explaining predicted consequences
(37%). In week 6, the students focused similarly on predicted
consequences (29%), evidence (27%), and mechanisms (23%). The number of
perspectives explained increased until week 3, and then became stable
until week 6. On average, the students explained three perspectives in
week 6, but it varied from one to four. - Quality of causal patterns: In
the sixth week, a large majority of the students’ explanations were
categorized as Medium (n = 11) or Medium–high (n = 5). Compared to the
first week, this is an increase of 41%. It is also worth noting that
none of the students’ explanations was at Medium–high in the first week,
whereas almost a third were in this category by week 6. These students
developed their explanations in terms of describing multiple causes and
effects, and by describing how these causal relationships were a part of
the whole system. More than half of the students (n = 11) ended up
having a medium quality to their explanations of climate change issues,
meaning that they identified multiple linear causalities involving
multiple indirect connections, used a variety of concepts, and linked
them properly together as valuable examples or complementary
information, and they described at least three perspectives for climate
change issues. Second question: is the quality of student explanations
linked to the peer interactions in the platform: - Twelve of 19 students
developed their explanations in terms of advancement; for example, they
better explained causalities using scientific concepts, by linking
concepts together, and explaining their perspectives regarding climate
change issues. These students interacted with their peers three times
more often on average compared to those who did not advance.

**Improved?**: All knowledge aspects improved over time, students used
more scientific concepts in their explanations, better quality of links
between concepts, with more variety in the perspectives and an overall
improved quality of the causal pattens

## 55.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: During their explanations in the wiki on climate
change: - Use of scientific concepts - Links between concepts - Use of
variety of perspectives - Quality of causal patterns (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 55.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The intervention (use of an internet platform where
students, chat, participate to discussions and create a wiki on climate
change) successfully improved the use of concepts by the students, the
relations between these concepts, and the quality of the scientific
explanations that the student gave. “The results of this study indicate
that international peer collaboration, if successfully supported, can be
an effective approach to climate change education.”

**Message to keep:**: The intervention (use of an internet platform
where students, chat, participate to discussions and create a wiki on
climate change) successfully improved the use of concepts by the
students, the relations between these concepts, and the quality of the
scientific explanations that the student gave. It is worth noting that
the activity articulated in a very smart way the local and global
climate change issues: the students from 4 countries (Norway, China,
Sweden and Canada even though only Norwegian students were analyses)
were put into groups on thematic and could develop local issues with
their peers from other countries. The interaction between those peers
seem to have a beneficial effects in the improvement of knowledge even
though there are some methodological uncertainties.

**title** Rethinking Quality Science Education for Climate Action:
Transdisciplinary Education for Transformative Learning and Engagement

## 56.1 abstract

Latest findings of the IPCC highlight the fact that there is an urgent
need for climate action on both individual and societal levels, because
political regulations and technical advances just would not be enough to
counter climate change. Acknowledging young people’s role as present and
future decision-makers, their engagement is absolutely imperative in
order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 13, “Climate Action.”
Therefore, new methods of teaching and learning are necessary, and they
need to encourage transformative learning, which, it is assumed, will
lay foundations for transformative engagement. Research in the field of
science education credits scientific literacy vision III as fostering
transformative learning and engagement. In this study, transdisciplinary
education is analyzed as a promising concept that enables exchange of
knowledge, experiences, and perspectives between students and scientific
partners while they jointly complete research on real-world issues. A
quantitative analysis capturing scientific literacy and transformative
engagement for climate action of Austrian and German secondary school
students (N = 162) is carried out alongside a literature review. This
study reveals that the didactical concept of transdisciplinary education
notably contributes to the implementation of scientific literacy vision
III as well as vision II. According to the results, the three visions of
scientific literacy are predictors for transformative engagement for
climate action, assuming to be preceded by a transformative learning
process. These encouraging findings need to be replicated by further
scholars in other contexts.

**title** Using empirical science education in schools to improve
climate change literacy

## 57.1 abstract

Providing children with a clear understanding of climate change drivers
and their mitigation is crucial for their roles as future earth
stewards. To achieve this, it will be necessary to reverse the declining
interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)
education in schools in the UK and other countries, as STEM skills will
be critical when designing effective mitigation solutions for climate
change. The ‘Heat-Cool Initiative’ was co-designed and successfully
implemented in five primary/secondary UK schools, as a playful learning
tool to unleash student interest in STEM subjects. 103 students from two
cohorts (years 5-6 and 7-9) participated in five Heat-Cool activity
sessions where they used infrared cameras to explore the issue of urban
heat. Their learning was evaluated using a multi-functional quantitative
assessment, including pre-and post-session quizzes. Climate change
literacy increased by 9.4% in primary school children and by 4.5% in
second-ary school children. Analyses of \>2000 infrared images taken by
students, categorised into 13 common themes, revealed age-related
differences in children’s cognitive development. At primary school age,
images of the ‘self’ dominated; secondary school children engaged more
with their physical environment. This novel approach demonstrated the
importance of developing tailored technology-enhanced STEM education
programmes for different age cohorts, leading to a high capacity for
improving learning outcomes regarding climate change. Such programmes,
embedded in school curricula nationally and internationally, could
become a much-needed positive contribution to reaching the United
Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goals 4 (Quality
Edu-cation) and 13 (Climate Action).

**title** Assessing Elementary Science Methods Students’ Understanding
About Global Climate Change

## 58.1 abstract

Global climate change, referred to as climate change in this paper, has
become an important planetary issue, and given that K-12 students have
numerous alternative conceptions or lack of prior knowledge, it is
critical that teachers have an understanding of the fundamental science
underlying climate change. Teachers need to understand the natural and
human-induced factors affecting climate, and the potential consequences,
and ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This study focusses on
assessing preservice and inservice teachers’ knowledge about climate
change at the beginning and end of an instructional intervention
embedded in an elementary science methods course. This paper describes
the development of an instrument derived from the constructive modeling
approach framework. The four components of this approach (the construct
map, items design, outcome space, and measurement model) are discussed.
In addition, the instructional intervention is described along with
findings from the study and an analysis of the instrument.

**title** Climate Change in the Preservice Teacher’s Mind

## 59.1 abstract

Given the recent media attention on the public’s shift in opinion toward
being more skeptical about climate change, 154 preservice teachers’
participated in an intervention in an elementary science methods course.
Findings indicated that students developed a deeper level of concern
about climate change. Their perceptions on the evidence for climate
change, consensus of scientists, impacts of climate change, and
influence of politics also changed significantly. The curriculum and
instruction appear to be an important factor in increasing understanding
of climate change and developing perceptions more aligned to those of
climate scientists. More broadly, this study provides preliminary
support for the value of providing a careful framing of the topic of
climate change within the context of science methods courses. © 2013 The

**Curricular/Extra**: Professional Development

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Elementary science methods course

**Description**: - Students were first introduced to the ‘’story’’ of
climate change through the film, ‘’An Inconvenient Truth.’’ The film
presented the evidence for climate change. We framed the classroom
discussion after the film to establish classroom discourse in which
scientific evidence was set as an expectation by students. - Students
were provided a 30-page study guide, developed by one of the authors,
based on a careful framing of the core science concepts underlying
weather and climate change. The guide was sequenced in a ‘’storyline’’
that builds on the basics for understanding the atmospheric composition
and factors that affect weather and climate. - Students were then
introduced to the methods used to study past climates, the natural and
humaninduced causes, the observed and projected impacts, and finally
suggestions for mitigating and adapting to climate change.

## 59.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre-post 43-item instrument was developed to specifically
measure students’ perspectives on (1) their self-reported knowledge of
climate change, (2) evidence (or indicators) of climate change, (3)
causes of climate change, (4) scientific consensus, (5) impacts of
climate change, (6) actions or solutions, (7) influence of politics on
the issue of climate change, and (8) trust of sources of information.

**Analysis**: A paired sample t test was conducted to compare changes in
students’ self-reported knowledge and levels of concern before and after
the methods course.

**Results**: The students’ self-reported knowledge of climate change
increased significantly, from 13.19 points (52 %) to 21.38 points (84 %)
out of a possible 25 points after participation in the methods course. -
The results indicated that, after completing the methods course,
students had developed a level of concern about climate change that was
significantly closer, from 58.00 (77 %) to 64.33 (86 %), to that held by
the majority of climate scientists. - The students’ views on the causes
of climate change were more reflective of scientists’ views at the end
of the course; however, the change was not significant.

**Improved?**: self-reported knowledge of climate improved - The level
of concern about climate change improved - Perceptions on the causes of
climate change didn’t change significatly

## 59.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Self-reported knowledge scores could range from a low of
5 to a high of 25 points. (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: These overall concern scores could range from 15 to 75,
the higher score indicating more concern about climate change.
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 59.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: - the gain in knowledge is related to the increase in
their concern about climate change. - the careful framing of climate
change seems to have been effective in changing perceptions about it and
promoting interest in the issue. - Climate change science has
unfortunately been highly politicized and misrepresented in the media.
Future and practicing teachers need to understand the difference between
appropriate scientific skepticism and denial of climate change. This
study seems to indicate that the influence of perceptions about climate
change can play a role in students’ motivation to learn the science
needed to understand this complex issue.

**Message to keep:**: Framing, the setting of an issue within an
appropriate context to achieve a desired interpretation or perspective,
can make climate science more accessible to the public. Framing helps
provide an interpretative lens or filter for choosing resources to
continue to develop their understanding of the science of climate
change. Based on the study, framing could make climate science more
accessible to preservice teachers.Climate science has the potential to
integrate ideas from multiple disciplines using climate change as the
organizing framework.

**title** Children can foster climate change concern among their parents

## 60.1 abstract

The collective action that is required to mitigate and adapt to climate
change is extremely difficult to achieve, largely due to
socio-ideological biases that perpetuate polarization over climate
change(1,2). Because climate change perceptions in children seem less
susceptible to the influence of worldview or political contexts(3), it
may be possible for them to inspire adults towards higher levels of
climate concern, and in turn, collective action(4). Child-to-parent
intergenerational learning-that is, the transfer of knowledge, attitudes
or behaviours from children to parents(5)-may be a promising pathway to
over-coming socio-ideological barriers to climate concerns(5). Here we
present an experimental evaluation of an educational intervention
designed to build climate change concern among parents indirectly
through their middle school-aged children in North Carolina, USA.
Parents of children in the treatment group expressed higher levels of
climate change concern than parents in the control group. The effects
were strongest among male parents and conservative parents, who,
consistent with previous research(1), displayed the lowest levels of
climate concern before the intervention. Daughters appeared to be
especially effective in influencing parents. Our results suggest that
intergenerational learning may overcome barriers to building climate
concern.

**title** Exploring local environmental change through filmmaking: the
Lentes en Cambio Climatico program

## 62.1 abstract

How can youth become leaders in their communities’ resilience efforts?
The Lentes en Cambio Climatico (LECC) filmmaking program aimed to
empower students to investigate how a changing climate affects their
lives and use their own findings to inspire local resilience. Secondary
students in LECC created films that explore the experiences of community
members and document local knowledge around climate topics relevant to
their lives. A mixed-methods study measured the program impacts on
students. Results from summer implementations in 2018 and 2019 suggest
that participation in LECC increased students’ awareness, confidence,
and engagement around climate topics and their interest in contributing
to community resilience efforts. Additionally, by leading community
discussions during film screening events, students gained confidence in
their leadership roles, and ability to share their expertise with
parents and community members. These conversations appeared to both
empower students and amplify their voices as advocates for change in
their communities. Supplemental data for this article is available
online at <https://doi.org/10.1080/00958964.2021.1949570> .

## 62.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Explore the extent to which producing films on local climate topics: a)
impacts students’ awareness of and perspectives on climate change, b)
increases students’ awareness of climate change’s causes and effects
and, c) transforms how students think, communicate about, and/or engage
in efforts to help mitigate local climate challenges.

**Questions**:

NA

## 62.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Audiovisual creation

**Description**: LECC workshops consisted of seven-days of informal
science learning. In these workshops, students learned about climate
change and filmmaking techniques before engaging with other students to
create their own films. The LECC workshops were divided into three
phases of filmmaking: pre-production (research and scripting),
production (filming), and post-production (editing)

## 62.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre and post workshop surveys (Awareness, 2018 and 2019) -
Transformative Experience questionnaire (Awareness, intention) -
post-workshop focus groups (2018) - individual student interviews
Interviews and post workshop interviews were transcribed and translated,
then coded by the researchers

**Analysis**: Pre- and Post- survey (likert scale) were analysed using
Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests Focus groups and interviews were coded and
analysed qualitatively using thematic analyses (Braun & Clarke,2006)

**Results**: Awareness: - better results in the surveys
(e.g. significance increase in their confidence on their knowledge on 4
aspects of climate change, p\<0.5 with medium or large effect size) -
interviews: 5 of 11 respondents (45.5%) mentioned an increaded awareness
of local climate change issue - focus groups: increased awareness around
the topic on which they made their films Intention: - from interviews
and focus groups: eight out of 12 (66%) mentioned the need or desire to
take actions, whether that was changing their own actions, feeling more
motivated or wanting to educate others Knowledge: - “While the study did
not aim at researching students’ knowledge gains around climate change,
we studied the self-report data on how well-informed the students felt
around climate change topics before and after their participation in the
program. Our data show significant increases with medium to large effect
sizes for students’ confidence in their understanding of climate
topics.” - note that the knowledge gains found through the qualitative
analyse of interviews and focus groups show that the knowledge comes
primarily from and on the topics that the students made their films on

**Improved?**: The LECC program had a measurable impact on students’
awareness and engagement around climate topics, and students described
feeling more agency to enact changes in the community that address
climate change. The data show as well significant increases with medium
to large effect sizes for students’ confidence in their understanding of
climate topics $$particularly in local topics related to the specific
topics of the films that each student made$$. Finally, many students
expressed the need or desire to take action, whether that was changing
their own actions, feeling more motivated to do something, or wanting to
educate others.

## 62.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Knowledge about local concrete effect of climate change
in Puerto Rico (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: 1. increased students awareness of climate changes causes
and effects 2. Recognition of its impact on their lives 3. awareness of
solutions to prevent or mitigate environmental challenges (*Worked?*:
Yes )

**intention**: Need or desire to do something through either personal or
group action (coded “action” by the researchers) (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 62.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The film production by the students improved their
awareness and intentions, particularly concerning the local topic of
their film

**Message to keep:**: The main message we should keep is that Art (film
production) activities may have a very positive effect on awareness and
intentions (knowledge is less important here). A side message, not
extracted in our variables is that the activities “empowered” the
students and made them agent of change in their communities. Interesting
paper because climate change education can have synergistic effects :
more people interested in science, bring more fun, etc.

**title** Ocean literacy gamified: A systematic evaluation of the effect
of game elements on students’ learning experience

## 63.1 abstract

Low levels of concern about anthropogenic climate change have been
attributed to a range of factors, some of which relate to education.
These include people’s lack of understanding and engagement with the
multifaceted nature and extent of the problem that it presents to
current and future generations. Limited knowledge is also known to be an
obstacle to individual behaviour change, with important implications for
young people’s perceptions of the urgency to act and awareness of the
consequences of their own behaviours. In this study, we explored ways to
address low levels of understanding about ocean science dimensions to
climate change phenomena, cognisant of a growing awareness that formal
education curricula do not adequately engage young people with
developing ocean literacy. Participants were a sample of secondary
school students (11 to 14 years) in Portugal and the UK. Using a
gamified mobile application, it was examined relationships between the
use of different game elements such as points, badges and leaderboards,
and learning outcomes. Systematic evaluation of each element shows how
different game features affected the participants’ learning experience
and learning outcomes. Implications for formal and informal marine
education, climate education, and how to improve ocean literacy efforts,
are also discussed.

**Objective**:

this study was conducted to understand if there is any relationship
between different game elements, such as points, badges, leaderboards
(also known as the PBL triad), and learning outcomes of ocean literacy.

**Questions**:

can different game elements impact the learning outcomes and, if so,
how?

## 63.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Portugal: Extracurricular UK: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Game application, lesson

**Description**: All student: 15 min class presentation on topics:
eutrophication, ocean plastic, sea level rise 4 groups of students with
differently designed game: - 1: game with points element - 2: game with
badge element - 3: game with leaderboard element -4: game with points,
badge, leaderboard elements (PBL triad) 1 control group (class
presentation but no game)

## 63.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Same questionnaire (correct/not correct/Don’t know) in all
treatments.

**Analysis**: Comparison of the correctedness of answers in the
treatments (game elements) and country with the control group (no game,
in both countries) with a model I factorial (orthogonal) ANOVA. Post-hoc
comparison of treatments with Dunnett test

**Results**: The application improve the acquisition of knowledge, the
game elements have a positive effect, which is lower when they enhance
too much the competition between students

**Improved?**: Overall results: the Ocean literacy mobile application
improve the acquisition of knowledge, compared to the oral explanation
only group. Concerning the element of the games: the results are
consistent in the 2 countries, the leaderboard element cause
competitions between students which may have a negative effect on the
acquisition of knowledge, but the other treatments (points, badges and
PBL triad: all elements) have a positive effects

## 63.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctedness of answers concerning ocean literacy
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 63.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The application improve the acquisition of knowledge,
the game elements have a positive effect, which is lower when they
enhance too much the competition between students

**Message to keep:**: Interesting use of games in addition to formal
lessons on ocean literacy. Overally the application (game) improve the
knowledge acquisition, and the gamification elements are more efficient
when they do not enhance too much the competition (over collaboration)
between students

**title** Social Activism in Elementary Science Education: A science,
technology, and society approach to teach global warming

## 64.1 abstract

As part of a large-scale instructional intervention research, this study
examined elementary students’ science knowledge and awareness of social
activism with regard to an increased greenhouse effect and global
warming. The study involved fifth-grade students from five elementary
schools of varying demographic makeup in a large urban school district
in the United States. The study was based on the analysis of students’
responses to a writing prompt addressing an increased greenhouse effect
and global warming at the beginning of and at the completion of
instruction over the school year. The results indicate that students
with adequate science knowledge tended to express activism more
frequently, and that their expression of activism increased as they
gained better science knowledge after the instruction. The results
highlight the importance of effective instruction of this contemporary
and controversial issue with K-12 students, so that they come to be
aware of this societal problem, take action in solving the problem, and
become socially responsible youth and adults.

## 64.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: instructional intervention

**Description**: “The Living Planet” unit with fifth-grade students. The
unit provides an introduction to the Earth as a planet of different
interacting cycles and systems (atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and
hydrosphere). The 12 lessons in the unit are correlated with national
and state standards in science Each of the 12 lessons includes an
eco-public service announcement narrated by contemporary actors and
musicians. The topics include the solar system, Earth’s seasons and
climate, plate tectonics, the rock cycle, Earth’s resources, and
endangered species.

## 64.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: na

**Analysis**: NA

**Results**: 36% the students in the upper range of science knowledge
(10 out of 28 students) gave correct responses on the pre-writing
sample, compared with 4% of the students in the lower range of science
knowledge (17 out of 392 students). On the post-writing sample, 42% of
the students in the upper range (54 out of 130 students) gave correct
responses, compared with 16% of the students in the lower range (45 out
of 290 students).

**Improved?**: na

## 64.6 Outcomes

## 64.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The fifth-grade students in this study had little
content knowledge of an increased greenhouse effect and global warming
before they participated in the instructional intervention. Even after
instruction over the school year, many students still had difficulty
with this topic. The results support the literature on students’
alternative conceptions and the persistence of such alternative
conceptions even after an instructional intervention

**title** Recognition and operationalization of Future-Scaffolding
Skills: Results from an empirical study of a teaching-learning module on
climate change and futures thinking

## 65.1 abstract

This article takes its point of departure from the younger generation’s
problematic relationship with time and the future. A general sense of
changeability and directionlessness in society compromises young
people’s confidence in themselves to make a difference as individuals in
important global issues affecting their futures, such as climate change.
Given recent aims and commitments of science education to promote
sustainable development and student agency, this study explores how
science teaching can help students imagine and face possible future
scenarios and develop agency in the present to influence them. This
article presents a science education approach to equip secondary school
students with skills of futures thinking and agency that we call
“future-scaffolding skills.” It also shows the process of building an
operational definition for recognizing those skills in students’
discourse and actions. For this purpose, an empirical study was carried
out in the context of a teaching-learning module on climate change,
consisting of activities inspired by the field of futures studies.
Essays, individual and group interviews, questionnaires, and video
recordings of students’ final projects were collected from 24 students
(16-19-years old) from three European countries. The results contribute
to operationally defining “future-scaffolding skills,” consisting of
“structural skills” (the ability to recognize temporal, logical and
causal relationships and build systemic views) and “dynamical skills”
(the ability to navigate scenarios, relating local details to global
views, past to present and future, and individual to collective
actions).

## 65.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Integrate CC knowledge, scientific reasoning and future-thinking as a
way to change student’s attitudes towards CC.

**Questions**:

- Students essays on a summer day on 2030
- Questionnaires on acquired knowledge after every day’s activities.
- Focus groups at the end of the summer school.
- Individual interviews some days after the summer school.
- Audio and Video recordings of the summer school’s activities.

## 65.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lectures and active learning exercises

**Description**: - Encountering the focal topics: lectures on CC as a
complex system, implications of CC on society in the present and in the
future. All contents were framed in “future cones”. - Scientific
conceptual-epistemological and inquiry activities: activities centered
on acquiring conceptual knowledge about CC, epistemological practices
around acquisition of knowledge (e.g. debating, modelling, giving
explanations…), and inquiry practices (eg. cyclical nature of science,
formulating hypothesis…). These were ofered through general lectures
followed by hand-on lab activities centered on stationary equilibrium of
CO2, transparency, absorbance of the athmosphere and temperature. -
Bridge activities: designed to bridge between scietific knowledge and
future reasoning. Include reading and conceptualizing scientific texts
and the presented positive/ negative feedback loops in the future. -
Future oriented activities: 1) imagine possible, plausible and desirable
future cones based on acquired conceptual knowledge. 2) activities
widening the range of possible actions along different STEM and non-STEM
(i.e. political, social…) fields. - Action competence activities:
Activities aiming at reflecting multiple perspectives on a single
decision and showcase ethical aspects of decision-making. This also

**title** Effectiveness Evaluation of a Primary School-Based
Intervention against Heatwaves in China

## 66.1 abstract

Background: Evidence of the effectiveness of intervention against
extreme heat remains unclear, especially among children, one of the
vulnerable populations. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness
of a primary school-based intervention program against heatwave and
climate change in China to provide evidence for development of policies
for adaptation to climate change. Methods: Two primary schools in
Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province, China, were randomly selected as
intervention and control schools (CTR registration number:
ChiCTR2200056005). Health education was conducted at the intervention
school to raise students’ awareness and capability to respond to extreme
heat during May to September in 2017. Knowledge, attitude, and practice
(KAP) of students and their parents at both schools were investigated by
questionnaire surveys before and after intervention. The changes in KAP
scores after intervention were evaluated using multivariable
difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, controlling for age, sex, etc.
Results: The scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice of students and
their parents increased by 19.9% (95%CI: 16.3%, 23.6%) and 22.5% (95%CI:
17.8%, 27.1%); 9.60% (95%CI: 5.35%, 13.9%) and 7.22% (95%CI: 0.96%,
13.5%); and 9.94% (95%CI: 8.26%, 18.3%) and 5.22% (95%CI: 0.73%, 9.71%),
respectively, after intervention. The KAP score changes of boys were
slightly higher than those of girls. Older students had higher score
changes than younger students. For parents, the higher the education
level, the greater the score change, and change in scores was greater in
females than in males. All the health education activities in the
program were significantly correlated with the changes in KAP scores of
primary school students after intervention, especially those curricula
with interesting activities and experiential learning approaches.
Conclusions: Heat and health education program in primary school was an
effective approach to improve cognition and behavior for both students
and their parents to better adapt to heatwaves and climate change. The
successful experience can be generalized to respond to the increasing
extreme weather/climate events in the context of climate change, such as
heatwaves, and other emergent occasions or public health education, such
as the control and prevention of COVID-19.

**title** Transformative experience in an informal science learning
program about climate change

## 68.1 abstract

The Transformative Experience Questionnaire (TEQ) has previously been
used only in formal science learning environments to examine how
students’ learning experiences extend beyond the classroom into their
daily lives. In the present study, an example of how this tool can be
useful to assess transformative experiences in an informal learning
program is provided. The Lens On Climate Change (LOCC) program combined
a place-based approach to learning with creative expression through
storytelling, as middle and high school participants created short films
about the impacts of climate change in their communities. Our findings
suggest the LOCC participants had a transformative experience with
regards to their learning about climate change as illustrated in greater
post-program TEQ scores over a comparison group of research participants
who did not engage in the LOCC program. The program was also
transformative for both middle and high school students. Results are
discussed within theoretical frameworks for designing informal
transformative science learning experiences.

## 68.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The current study focused on whether or not the program was
transformative for the LOCC participants, such that they left the
program feeling inspired to continue learning and/or communicating with
others about climate change or inspired to engage in actions to help
mitigate climate change or other environmental challenges in their
communities.

**Questions**:

1.  Did condition (intervention/comparison) statistically significantly
    predict the participants’ scores on the TEQ at posttest, above and
    beyond grade level (middle school/high school), and timing of
    program (summer/academic year), controlling for pretest TEQ scores?
2.  Where did the participants’ measures fall along the TE continuum
    from before to after the LOCC program?

## 68.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Informal science education program

**Description**: The Lens On Climate Change (LOCC) program was an
informal science education program in which middle and high school
students explored the local effects that climate change had on their
lives and communities and shared their findings through a short film, as
an artistic and engaging way to communicate about a topic. The program
took place in two formats—as an after-school program during the school
year and as an intensive, one-week summer program.

## 68.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre-post 15.item instrument

**Analysis**: Once pre- and posttest TE measures were on a similar
scale, the research questions were addressed using traditional
statistical methods using the equated and calibrated person measures
(logits) rather than raw scores. The item difficulty mean is set at 0 in
Rasch with higher person measures indicating higher levels of TE and
lower person measures indicating lower levels of TE

**Results**: Descriptive statistics for participants’ pre- and posttest
TE scores are reported in Table 2 in logits where higher scores indicate
a higher level of TE. As reported in Table 2, the intervention group’s
average TE score increased by 0.85 logits, increasing the average score
from at to above the item mean set at 0 logits. The comparison group’s
average TE score increased by 0.18 and remained below the item mean.

**Improved?**: When controlling for pretest TE scores, the intervention
group members had a higher score on the posttest TE compared to those in
the comparison group.

## 68.6 Outcomes

**other**: Yes (*Worked?*: As the LOCC participants researched topics,
interviewed experts and developed films around a locally relevant topic,
their posttest TEQ scores shifted toward higher engagement around the
topic from before to after the program. This growth was statistically
significantly greater for the LOCC participants than the comparison
group. )

## 68.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: - Our findings highlight the need to further examine
the degree to which different informal learning settings (e.g.,
libraries, museums, after-school and other short-term programs) provide
TEs for participants. More research could be done to explore ways to
engage participants in a TE given the unique opportunities and
challenges of informal, non-guided educational settings. - The findings
of the present study around the impacts of informal learning programs
are important for science learning broadly, but they are also important
in a time when concerns about the immediate and longterm effects of
climate change are growing. TEs have the potential to not only increase
young people’s interest in science, but also to encourage them to
continue their learning, communicate about the science with others, and
contribute to actions to mitigate environmental challenges and lead to a
more sustainable future.

**Message to keep:**: When it comes to climate change, we are no longer
in a position to “wait and see” what will happen in the future. There is
an urgent need for immediate action, and this requires new thinking from
youth and adults alike. Future research should seek to understand how
existing frameworks that focus on TE (Transformative Experiences) and
sociocultural connections with science topics in informal learning
settings can come together to empower youth to become active
participants in science and sustainability efforts.

**title** In-service Teachers’ Attitudes, Knowledge and Classroom
Teaching of Global Climate Change

## 69.1 abstract

This study explores in-service teachers’ attitudes and knowledge about a
pressing environmental issue, “global climate change” (GCC), and how
these may relate to their classroom teaching. In this work, nineteen
teachers from Native American communities attended a professional
development workshop that focused on enhancing their scientific
understanding and classroom teaching of GCC. Teachers’ responses to
surveys and interviews revealed that the majority of them considered GCC
as mainly human-induced and shared similar concerns about potential
consequences of GCC, but their specific ecological beliefs varied to
different degrees. Throughout the workshop, teachers became more aware
of the urgency of GCC and the importance of incorporating climate issues
into their science teaching. However, teachers’ attitudes and beliefs
about GCC were not strong indicators of their level of knowledge, as
misconceptions were sometimes found among teachers who were very
concerned about climate issues. This work opens up further discussions
on the relationship between individuals’ attitudes and knowledge about
environmental issues. More importantly, it provides important
implications for future professional development programs on climate
change education and proposes effective tools to evaluate teachers’
perspectives about GCC.

**Results**: While most teachers’ attitudes toward GCC stayed the same
throughout the workshop, there were attitude changes among some
teachers. In particular, teachers who were on The skeptical end of the
spectrum became more aware of the significance of GCC and its potential
threat to humans and shifted their attitudes about GCC. The Current
findings indicate that professional development may induce attitude
changes on the topic of GCC. By the end of the workshop, most of the
participant teachers had a basic understanding of climate science. Most
of them were able to provide details about the causes and scientific
processes of GCC, although misconceptions persisted for some teacher

**title** Plausibility reappraisals and shifts in middle school
students’ climate change conceptions

## 70.1 abstract

Plausibility is a central but under-examined topic in conceptual change
research. Climate change is an important soda-scientific topic; however,
many view human-induced climate change as implausible. When learning
about climate change, students need to make plausibility judgments but
they may not be sufficiently critical or reflective. The purpose of this
study was to examine how students’ plausibility judgments and knowledge
about human-induced climate change transform during instruction
promoting critical evaluation. The results revealed that treatment group
participants who engaged in critical evaluation experienced a
significant shift in their plausibility judgments toward the
scientifically accepted model of human-induced climate change. This
shift was accompanied by significant conceptual change postinstruction
that was maintained after a six-month delay. A comparison group who
experienced a climate change activity that is part of their normal
curriculum did not experience statistically significant changes. (c)

## 70.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: NA

**Analysis**: NA

**Results**: treatment group participants experienced significant
changes in their perceptions of model plausibility and knowledge of
human-induced climate change after experiencing instruction that

## 70.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: This study expands our understanding of conceptual
change and specifically helps support the idea that experiencing
conceptual change about human-induced climate change is neither a simple
matter of debunking non-scientific positions nor just learning about the
several lines of evidence that support the scientific model. Rather,
moving toward the scientifically accepted conception that Humans are
altering Earth’s climate may well require connecting evidences to
alternative models, evaluating the strength of these connections with
respect to each alternative, and explicitly reappraising the
plausibility of each alternative

**title** Impact of cooperative learning and project-based learning
through emotional intelligence: A comparison of methodologies for
implementing SDGs

## 71.1 abstract

Education for sustainable development (ESD) is a holistic and
transformative form of education that seeks action-oriented pedagogy
using self-directed learning, participation, and collaboration, among
other aspects, and is suitable for developing active methodologies.
Since affective-emotional aspects can contribute in the
teaching-learning process, this work studies, through a case study, the
comparison of the influence of two active methodologies: Cooperative
Learning (CL) and Project-Based Learning (PBL) in student emotions and
learning processes, as well as their awareness of ESD. For that purpose,
a survey was conducted at the fourth secondary level in the science
laboratory, subjected to the innovation project e-WORLD, which developed
the content of the 7 and 13 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from
the 2030 Agenda. Results of ANOVA and Tukey’s tests carried out showed
that both methodologies improved skills and knowledge related to climate
change and energy, and triggered major positive emotions in students.
Furthermore, CL allowed students to acquire more individual and group
responsibility than communication skills developed with PBL. It is
necessary to continue working on the involvement of students in these
methodologies in order to improve their social skills and to reveal life
changes towards more socio-sustainable ones.

## 71.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Active methodologies can favor the capacity for
meaningful learning through an increase in student motivation, thanks to
encouraging positive emotions and the ability to learn

**Message to keep:**: The focus of this paper is on the effect of two
active learning strategies on learning and emotions. There is little
info regarding CC, despite the intervention being aimed at reducing CO2
emissions. Both active methodologies improve knowledge on energy and CC
concepts. No differences in knowledge by type of methodology.

**title** Immersive Virtual Reality Field Trips Facilitate Learning
About Climate Change

## 72.1 abstract

Across four studies, two controlled lab experiments and two field
studies, we tested the efficacy of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as an
education medium for teaching the consequences of climate change,
particularly ocean acidification. Over 270 participants from four
different learning settings experienced an immersive underwater world
designed to show the process and effects of rising sea water acidity. In
all of our investigations, after experiencing immersive VR people
demonstrated knowledge gains or inquisitiveness about climate science
and in some cases, displayed more positive attitudes toward the
environment after comparing pre- and post-test assessments. The analyses
also revealed a potential post-hoc mechanism for the learning effects,
as the more that people explored the spatial learning environment, the
more they demonstrated a change in knowledge about ocean acidification.
This work is unique by showing distinct learning gains or an interest in
learning across a variety of participants (high school, college
students, adults), measures (learning gain scores, tracking data about
movement in the virtual world, qualitative responses from classroom
teachers), and content (multiple versions varying in length and content
about climate change were tested). Our findings explicate the
opportunity to use immersive VR for environmental education and to drive
information-seeking about important social issues such as climate
change.

## 72.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This is the first of 4 studies, on which authors tested the effect o
different aspects of immersive VR on learning about marine science:
Study 1 tested the physical experience (haptic, auditory, and other
sensory feedback experienced throughout a virtual world). Studies 2,3,4
don´t apply because they were performed with other populations.

**Questions**:

NA

## 72.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Mediated learning: Inmersive virtual reality

**Description**: Students participated in activities based on
traditional practices of marine scientists, who dive underwater and
interact with species of ﬂora and fauna to measure biodiversity (Dive
1). Then, they had an inmersive virtual reality experience modeled after
the Ischian Reef in Italy, where naturally occurring carbon dioxide
vents acidify certain areas of the reef and provide scientists with a
window into a future aﬀected by climate change. Then the had another
field physical experience.

## 72.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Open questionare about ocean acidiﬁcation: (1) What it is (2)
What is the most signiﬁcant cause of ocean acidiﬁcation?, (3) What the
predicted eﬀects of increasing ocean acidiﬁcation (4) How do coral and
other sea creatures build their hard skeletons and shells?, (5) How much
carbon dioxide is absorbed by the planet’s oceans each year?, and (6)
How much has the pH level of the ocean changed since the industrial
revolution?. Responses were coded by expert on a 1-7 scale Attitude or
concern: New Ecological Paradigm (NEP; Dunlap et al., 2000), 7- point
Likert scales, where participants responded to assertions such as “We
are approaching the limit of the number of people the earth can
support,” “Humans were meant to rule over the rest of nature,” and “The
balance of nature is very delicate and easily upset

**Analysis**: Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear mixed models
with a random eﬀect for participant to account for multiple,
non-independent observations by each student.

**Results**: There was knowledge gain from the whole experience and in
particular from the inmersive virtual reality experience

**Improved?**: Knowledge about ocean identification, no enronmrntal
concern

## 72.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: (1) demonstrating knowledge gain about the process and
causes of ocean acidiﬁcation (*Worked?*: yes )

**emotions**: Envirnmental concern that is, changing attitudes toward
the ocean environment and ocean acidiﬁcation (*Worked?*: no )

## 72.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: THere is not a decaration regarding the
educational approach, other than the use of mediated learning, however,
this fall within the experiential learning category. Authors say :“Our
interest in climate change education stems from the importance of
bringing complex issues closer to people psychologically (Schuldt et
al., 2016) and is also inspired by recent calls for innovative teaching
methods to address environmental concerns (e.g., mobile games; McCright
et al., 2013; Wu and Lee, 2015).”

**title** Discussing the Greenhouse Effect: children’s collaborative
discourse reasoning and conceptual change

## 73.1 abstract

Summary: In environmental education the construction of appropriate
knowledge is not enough, but is undoubtedly a fundamental component of
individual and collective environmental responsiveness. The aim of this
study was to investigate fifth graders’ changes of conceptions about the
greenhouse effect and global warming, due to socio-cognitive interaction
developed in small and large group discussions in an authentic classroom
context during the implementation of an environmental education
curriculum unit. We hypothesized that a classroom transformed into a
community of discoursei.e. a learning environment which stimidates and
supports giving verbal explanations, comparing and critically evaluating
different points of view on the examined environmental phenomenon, would
be a fruitful breeding ground for knowledge revision. The results show
that classroom discussions, the core of the proposed learning activity,
led the children, although at different levels, to the integration of
new scientific knowledge into their conceptual ecology, based on the
personal revision of pre-instructional conceptions. As hypothesized, a
high positive correlation was found between conceptual change and
metaconceptual awareness of the changes in pre-existing representations
of the examined phenomenon. Some implications are drawn from the
standpoint of environmental education. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group,

## 73.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Does collaborative discourse reasoning improve explanations $$of CC$$ at
the individual level? In other words, what conceptual progress can be
identified inlearners’ individual explanations of the greenhouse effect
as appropriation of knowledge constructed through socio-cognitive
interaction in group discussions? Is the conceptual development $$of
CC$$ of learners related to their metaconceptual awareness of the
changes that occured in their knowledge structures about the examined
phenomenon due to instructional intervention?

**Questions**:

1)  how does the Earth get warmed normally?
2)  the scientists maintain that the Earth is getting warmer and warmer.
    In your opinion what are the possible causes of this phenomenon?
3)  if the greenhouse effect got bigger what would be the consequences;
4)  what could be done to reduce the greenhouse effect?

## 73.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Small and large group discussions

**Description**: 40 min session in two phases: - small group discussion
on several CC-related topics (mechanisms of CC, consequences and
possible solutions). - large group discussion: compare different views
on the main topics and creation of a shared representation.

## 73.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre- and post- interviews on conceptual understanding of CC
(cuases, consequences and solutions) and metaconceptual knowledge of CC.

**Analysis**: Top - down analysis and correlation between
meta-conceptual awareness and conceptual understanding.

**Results**: Students appear to understand better CC and to be mindful
of their own understanding of CC.

**Improved?**: NA

## 73.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Pre-post interviews and surveys on CC mechanisms,
consequences and possible reduction actions (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 73.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Socio-constructivist pedagogies made it easier for
children to change their understanding of CC.

**Message to keep:**: Intervention based on small and large group
discussion seems to foster CC knowledge.

**title** “I now deeply care about the effects humans are having on the
world”: cultivating ecological care and responsibility through complex
systems modelling and investigations

## 74.1 abstract

Objective: Systems thinking can be counterintuitive to everyday ways of
knowing. This can surface doubt around predicted patterns of emergence
in complex systems data, especially as it relates to the current climate
crisis and related justice-oriented solutions. Method: Our study
describes a four-year design-based research project in which we engaged
high school biology students in complex systems modelling to understand
linkages between increasing ocean temperatures and the rate and severity
of disease outbreaks in sea stars. Results: Our findings showed that
students approached climate data with uncertainty and viewed their lives
as separate from the impacts of climate change. Through iterative design
work, youth used authentic data and computational tools to construct
geospatial and causal-loop models of climate-related disease outbreaks
that situated case studies within broader socioecological and
sociotechnical contexts of historic and powered human actions. Through a
speculative design lens, models were transformed from data visualization
tools to mediums for storying and re-storying present and future worlds
for multispecies survival in the face of the climate crisis. Conclusion:
Students shifted their understandings of disease outbreaks from a
technical perspective to a more social and situated lens of care and
responsibility for mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis on human
and more-than-human communities. KEY POINTS What is already known about
this topic: (1) Teachers that cover climate change often focus solely on
technical and data-based aspects during instruction, such as the carbon
cycle and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, without including the
social and political contexts through which the climate emergency
emerged. (2) Engaging students in meaningful action and problem-solving
creates positive affective outcomes and retains hope in students in the
face of future climate impacts. (3) There is still more that we need to
learn about how to design learning environments that cultivate hope,
agency, and multispecies caring in K-12 contexts. What this topic adds:
(1) We show how complex systems modelling and data visualization can
cultivate multispecies caring and climate action by situating
climate-related phenomena in larger socioecological and sociotechnical
systems. (2) Through a speculative design lens, we show how modelling
can be transformed from data visualization to storytelling and
re-storying present and future worlds that centre on ecological and
multispecies flourishing. Here we show a new ontological dimension of
modelling practices as future and world making. (3) Our research shows
how multispecies caring emerged as an action in this world, and for
creating the future worlds students wanted to see; it became an
affective dimension for making meaning amid the complexity and
uncertainty of the climate crisis. © 2022 Australian Psychological
Society.

## 74.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Shifted student’sr understandings of CC from a technical perspective to
a more social and situated lens of care and responsibility for
mitigation.

**Questions**:

- What environmental factors might be contributing to the scale and
  severity of SSWD?
- How has human behaviour and decision-making contributed to disease
  outbreaks, including SSWD?
- How can we support sea star (and other species) long-term health and
  survival in a time of rapid climate change?

## 74.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: 10 week curriculum on SSWD co-created by teachers and climate
science experts.

**Description**: Anchor: - Technical knowledge on the anatomy and
function of the sea star. Mostly traditional classes. - Classification
of photographs of sea stars in various levels of disease (UC Santa Cruz
MARINEe programme
(<https://marine.ucsc.edu/data-products/sea-star-wasting/index.html>).
) - Graph creation: link between SSWD and Sea temperature over time
complemented by geomapping. Complex systems modelling - Causal-loops
models to situate SSWD in a broader socio-ecological context. - Refining
causal-loops with new information/ classes. - Infographic and poster
creation. Community engagement: - Poster and infographic presentation to
a larger audience.

## 74.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Ethnographic observation and focus groups.

**Analysis**: Retrospective analysis and iterative coding (both
predetermined and iterative codes) based on Ethnographic observations,
focal groups and biweekly surveys

**Results**: Awareness: students report being more aware of CC and its
consequences. - Knowledge: students produce more nuanced and
contextualised explanations of SSWD, its link to CC and its broader
social causes and consequences. - Emotion: Students report being more
engaged and caring more for the environment. - Action: Students produced
infographics and posters presented to stakeholders to foster climate
protection.

**Improved?**: All, specially attitudes turned drastically in favor of
caring for the environment as opposed to simply having techinical
knowledge about it.

## 74.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Understanding of SSWD as having social as well as
climatic origins and consequences. (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Awareness of social as well as climatic causes and
consequences of SSWD (*Worked?*: Yes )

**emotions**: Attitude of caring and responsibility towards CC and its
consequences on other living beings. (*Worked?*: Yes )

**action**: Reaching out to decision-makers about CC. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 74.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Really effective intervention and well documented.

**Message to keep:**: Very complete intervention fostering a more
complex understanding of CC and facilitating action. Deserves a
follow-up and expansion. Could have been helped by a pre-existing
institutional commitment to environmental protection in the observed
schools since they were already interested in urban gardening and
similar activities.

## 75.1 abstract

ABSTRACTThis study reports on an effort to illustrate the coupling of
educational research with ongoing curriculum development to promote
effective and evidence-based online learning. The research findings have
been used to inform the EarthLabs curriculum development team as they
revise existing modules and create new modules, in order to represent
the ways in which such research findings can be used to improve similar
online curriculum materials and enhance student learning outcomes.
EarthLabs curriculum is a suite of online inquiry-based activities that
promote understanding of Earth system science. Assessments were employed
to understand student learning about complex climate systems as a result
of their engagement with the online EarthLabs curriculum. Collection of
pre- and postcourse student assessment data (n = 205), classroom
observations during implementation (n = 6), teacher interviews (n = 7),
and eye-tracking data (n = 49) were included in the study. Qualitative
and quantitative findings show that EarthLabs classroom implementation
significantly improves students’ conceptual and systems understanding
and that students and external users are appropriately engaged with the
online materials. These findings have been applied to evaluating the
efficacy of the EarthLabs program in reaching target programmatic and
learning goals, as well as to developing a broader understanding of the
cognitive challenges students have in navigating complex Earth systems
phenomena, where continued EarthLabs program revision has occurred
through design-based research.

## 75.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Online curriculum with an iterative process:
create-test-revise-implement-revise

**Description**: “Earth Science and environmental science curriculum
materials that engage high school students in a combination of Web-based
activities, hands-on experiments, and scientific data analysis, with the
ultimate goal of providing easily accessible, inexpensive, and effective
inquiry-based experiences (Ledley et al., 2012). Labs evaluated here
intended to build on the knowledge and skills learned in the previous
labs.” Activities combine online reading, data manipulation and
visualization using software applications such as Google Earth and
ImageJ, hands-on activities, and outdoor explorations. Each lab within
an EarthLabs module contains ‘’Checking In’’ and ‘’Stop and Think’’
questions that assist students and teachers in gauging learning
progress.

## 75.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Incorporated multiple levels of data collected from teachers
(perceived success in implementation), high school students (conceptual
understanding, in-class observation of interactions and engagement with
hands on excercises), and eye-tracking data (engagement with online
materials).

**Analysis**: For pre-post comparisons used two rubrics, thematic
analysis of interview and open-ended responses, descriptive statistics
and parametric or nonparametric tests. Pre/postassessments included four
to six open-ended response questions that were aligned to curriculum
learning goals and materials, six demographic items, and one self-
confidence item for each question set. Responses were scored using a
conceptual understanding rubric (score 0–5) Used a paired Student’s
t-test when assumptions of the test were satisfied, or Wilcoxon signed
ranks test was used for nonparametric analysis.

**Results**: There were significant increases on conceptual
understandind and systems understanding of Cryosphere and ESS modules.

**Improved?**: There were significant increases on conceptual
understandin of Cryosphere and ESS modules. However, numerous
misconceptions persisted despite intruction on Cryosphere module. THere
were significant increases in Systems understanding on both modules as
well. Additionally, in-class observations suggest that students were
highly engage in activities and thus (according to authors) change can
be attributed to the modules

**title** Urban High School Students’ Critical Science Agency:
Conceptual Understandings and Environmental Actions Around Climate
Change

## 76.1 abstract

This study investigates how the enactment of a climate change curriculum
supports students’ development of critical science agency, which
includes students developing deep understandings of science concepts and
the ability to take action at the individual and community levels. We
examined the impact of a four to six week urban ecology curriculum on
students from three different urban high schools in the USA. Data
collection included pre and posttest written assessments from all
students (n = 75) and pre and post interviews from focal students (n =
22) to examine how students’ conceptual understandings, beliefs and
environmental actions changed. Our analyses showed that at the beginning
of the curriculum, the majority of students believed that climate change
was occurring; yet, they had limited conceptual understandings about
climate change and were engaged in limited environmental actions. By the
end of the curriculum, students had a significant increase in their
understanding of climate change and the majority of students reported
they were now engaged in actions to limit their personal impact on
climate change. These findings suggest that believing a scientific
theory (e.g. climate change) is not sufficient for critical science
agency; rather, conceptual understandings and understandings of personal
actions impact students’ choices. We recommend that future climate
change curriculum focus on supporting students’ development of critical
science agency by addressing common student misconceptions and by
focusing on how students’ actions can have significant impacts on the
environment.

## 76.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The study investigates how the enactment of a climate change curriculum
supports students’ development as climate literate citizens specifically
in terms of the impact on both students’ knowledge and personal
environmental actions about climate change.

**Questions**:

1.  How do high school students’ understandings of climate change alter
    after a curricular unit focused on the topic?
2.  How do high school students’ beliefs about climate change alter
    after a curricular unit focused on the topic?
3.  How do high school students’ environmental actions about climate
    change alter after a curricular unit focused on the topic?

## 76.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, discusions

**Description**: The study took place during a high school urban ecology
curriculum, Urban Ecolab: How do we develop healthy and sustainable
cities? The curriculum was developed as a capstone course for high
school students to engage students in environmental science and connect
the science to their cities and their lives. The curriculum includes
eight modules. Specifically, this study focuses on the second module,
which examined energy and climate change. The curriculum focused on a
number of key science ideas, such as the causes and consequences of
global climate change. The second module had eleven lessons.

## 76.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre-post questionnaries and pre-post interviews

**Analysis**: Pre and Post For the multiple-choice items, we scored and
tallied all six items based on whether or not students selected the
appropriate response for a possible total of six points. - Student
Interviews All of the pre and post interviews for the twenty-two
students were transcribed. We then developed the coding scheme for the
transcripts from both our theoretical framework and an iterative
analysis of the data.

**Results**: Students understood significantly more about what global
climate change is, the causes of global climate change and the effects
of global climate change after the curriculum unit compared to before
the unit. - Students were also more likely to talk about the role of
humans and how their actions are impacting the environment suggesting
they developed a greater understanding of how personal actions impact
climate change. - The percentage of students that discussed engaging in
all of the different personal environmental actions increased.

**Improved?**: Knowledge, awareness and behavior improved in the
postests

## 76.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Students understood significantly more about what global
climate change is (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: an increase in their understanding of the causes and
consequences of climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**action**: On the pos-interview 86% of the students said they were
personally doing something to limit their impact on climate change
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**habit**: Yes (*Worked?*: The percentage of students that discussed
engaging in all of the different personal environmental actions
increased. )

## 76.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Critical science agency is essential for scientific
literacy that not only supports students in understanding the world
around them, but also promotes responsible scientific behaviors for
environmental topics, but also other socioscientific issues. In today’s
science and technology infused world, individuals need to make informed
and responsible decisions and engage in actions that impact not only
themselves, but also their community and their environment.

**Message to keep:**: The promulgation of a climate change curriculum
promotes the development of critical science agency, which includes
students developing deep understandings of science concepts and the
ability to take action at the individual and community levels.
Nevertheless, that believing a scientific theory (e.g. climate change)
is not sufficient for critical science agency; rather, conceptual
understandings and understandings of personal actions impact students’
choices.

**title** Effectiveness of gaming for communicating and teaching climate
change

## 77.1 abstract

Games are increasingly proposed as an innovative way to convey
scientific insights on the climate-economic system to students,
non-experts, and the wider public. Yet, it is not clear if games can
meet such expectations. We present quantitative evidence on the
effectiveness of a simulation game for communicating and teaching
international climate politics. We use a sample of over 200 students
from Germany playing the simulation game KEEP COOL. We combine pre- and
postgame surveys on climate politics with data on individual in-game
decisions. Our key findings are that gaming increases the sense of
personal responsibility, the confidence in politics for climate change
mitigation, and makes more optimistic about international cooperation in
climate politics. Furthermore, players that do cooperate less in the
game become more optimistic about international cooperation but less
confident about politics. These results are relevant for the design of
future games, showing that effective climate games do not require
climate-friendly in-game behavior as a winning condition. We conclude
that simulation games can facilitate experiential learning about the
difficulties of international climate politics and thereby complement
both conventional communication and teaching methods.

## 77.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Determine effect of the game on perceptions of personal responsability,
confidence in politicians, beliefs on international cooperation and
pessimism about CC. Link in-game decisions to optimism/pesimism about
climate politics.

**Questions**:

Six items were newly designed to capture beliefs about international
climate politics (pre- and post-intervention). in-game decisions: number
of “green” and “black” decisions and self-reported teamplay.

## 77.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: serious gaming

**Description**: A computer simulation game in which each participant
takes the role of a country belonging to one of 6 broad categories
(developing countries, Western Europe, ex-USSR countries, OPEC, rapidly
industrializing countries and umbrella group). Players must chose
between “green” and “black” technologies, adapt to CC or research on
climate research to achieve a number of country-specific objectives.
Over the in-game rounds, global temperature rises according to player’s
decisions and all players lose if a critical threshold is reached. A
player wins when they achieve a number or arbitary objectives.

## 77.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-/post- surveys.

**Analysis**: Linear regressions comparing pre- and post-game beliefs
about climate politics and personal responsibility.

**Results**: Significant pre- / post- change in the expected direction.

**Improved?**: Personal responsibility, confidence and pessimis on
climate politics.

## 77.6 Outcomes

**emotions**: Pesimism about CC lower in the post intervention
(*Worked?*: yes )

**other**: Personal responsibility and beliefs about climate politics
and international cooperation (*Worked?*: yes )

## 77.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Game has a significant effect on climate politics
(international cooperation) as well as personal responsibility and
climate pessimism, not on confidence in politicians.

**Message to keep:**: Tabletop game directly shows the social and
political variables at play in CC politics changing personal
responsibility and political pbeliefs about CC.

ABSTRACT: Climate change is a highly charged topic that some adults
prefer to ignore. If the same holds true for secondary students,
teachers could be challenged to teach about climate change. We
structured one activity about the biological concepts of carbon cycle
and carbon sequestration in two ways: with and without mention of
climate change. Results suggested that students (n = 22) who learned
about carbon in the context of climate change made significant
improvements in their knowledge of the carbon cycle and sequestration
over those (n = 24) who learned about carbon without mention of climate
change. Interest in climate change may increase learning. © 2016 Taylor

## 79.1 abstract

The United Nations Children’s Fund 2008 report, Our Climate, Our
Children, Our Responsibility, warned that children will suffer most from
the effects of climate change. Environmental education is one way to
prepare children to cope and enable them to educate their families and
friends about the need to act now to minimise the danger climate change
poses. This article reports on findings from a participatory action
research project aimed at integrating education for sustainable
development into the Grade 7 curriculum, with a specific focus on
climate change. Critical participatory action research has a
transformative intent, engaging participants in learning to cultivate a
sense of purpose and increase their capacity to solve local problems.
Learner responses to qualitative questionnaires and recorded discussions
related to the Do One Thing (DOT) strategy were used to determine
learning about climate change and enable both learners and community
members to identify action for change. Thematic coding was used to
evaluate the effectiveness of the DOT strategy in increasing awareness
of agency and resultant learning. The findings indicate that not only
did the learners gain knowledge about the causes and consequences of
climate change but the potential of the learners and community members
to identify possible actions for change was increased as well. We
provide suggestions as to how teachers can use the DOT strategy as part
of an action research approach to integrating environmental education
for sustainable development in order to raise awareness of local
environmental threats and encourage learners and their families to
behave in a more environmentally friendly way. The explanation of the
research process offered in this article also highlights how
participatory learning activities can help engage learners as active
agents in their own learning.

## 80.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

In this project, we aimed to develop learners as citizen scientists to
be able to counteract the negative effects of these hindrances and
encourage the adoption of environmentally friendly behaviour.

**Questions**:

“How can Grade 7 teachers use the DOT strategy to raise awareness about,
and encourage action to mitigate, climate change?”

## 80.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Project-based learning strategy, DOT (Do It a Thing)

**Description**: - The DOT project supports the infusion of climate
change knowledge into a range of school subjects such as life skills,
social science, and natural science and technology. Teachers who
attended the workshops linked topics in their respective subjects to
climate change. Learners were tasked to explore subject content and use
the information gleaned to guide action on climate change in their
communities. - The learners were requested to discuss what they had
learnt in the classroom about climate change with a responsible adult at
home (a family member or family friend) and ask them to indicate on a
paper “leaf” (provided by the teacher) one thing they could think of to
lessen the harmful effects of climate change in their community. The
learners were to do the same on another leaf. The next day, the learners
came to school with the two leaves that indicated their ideas on the
action they could take to combat climate change. They were asked to post
the leaves on a “DOT tree”.

## 80.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Interviews and surveys

**Analysis**: The data set consisted of (i) pledges of both the
community and learners captured on the DOT leaves and (ii) learners’
responses to open-ended questions: (a) Explain your understanding of the
concept climate change, (b) Discuss your learning from the Skype meeting
with the USA learners, and (c) Indicate three more things you can do to
lessen the impact of climate change. We compared the answers to (a) with
the transcribed discussion with community members in Cycle 1. Thematic
coding of qualitative data (Tesch, 1990, as explained in Creswell, 2009)
provided insight into the dynamics of teaching climate change and the
influence of the DOT project on the learning of Grade 7 learners.

**Results**: The ability of participants to link climate change to
specific environmental indicators, such as ozone depletion, air
pollution, and the loss of natural life, suggests an enhanced awareness
of climate change effects from a scientific perspective. - The
assumption can be made that exposure to climate change in the curriculum
has enabled the learners to propose strategies to mitigate climate
change on a wider scale. - The Skype discussions with peers at a school
in Louisville, Kentucky, in America provided the learners with an
opportunity to showcase their knowledge on climate change as capable,
informed citizens

**Improved?**: Awareness of climate change improved. - There was
Increased Commitment to Adopt Environmentally Friendly Behaviour - An
Improved Ability to Communicate About Climate Change

## 80.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: Because the participants understood that climate change
resulted from the actions of humans. (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: the participants were inspired to pledge to put their
litter in bins instead of discarding it in public spaces. (*Worked?*:
Yes )

**action**: The South African learners spoke of the water and air
pollution they faced daily. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 80.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The DOT strategy proved to be an effective way to make
young learners aware of their responsibility towards society and the
need to promote a healthy natural environment in their communities.
Although social change regarding positive activities cannot be concluded
by one cycle in a project, the findings of this small-scale study
indicate that PAR projects incorporating participatory pedagogies such
as the DOT strategy are useful, not only to reach educational outcomes
but also to enable learners (and community members) to become advocates,
if not activists, for climate change in their communities.

**Message to keep:**: The DOT assignment inspired interest and
engagement by requiring learners to act as educators and advocates of
more environmentally responsible behaviour. There is the need to connect
teaching about climate change more closely to the impacts thereof on
learners’ own communities, and to train teachers to cope with any
negative emotion learners may experience.

**title** The Integration of Environmental Pollution Materials in Social
Studies Learning in School for Anticipation of Climate Change

## 81.1 abstract

Social studies learning is expected to integrate environmental
education, in accordance with the objectives of social studies learning
to improve students’ thinking skills, social problem solving skills and
care for the environment In fact, social studies teachers were found to
have not utilized the physical or social environment as a source of
learning, despite various environmental pollutions have often occurred
in Indonesia and resulted in global warming as an indication of climate
change. This research was intended to 1) identify materials of
environmental pollution around students as a source of social studies
learning; 2) integrate environmental pollution materials in social
studies learning to anticipate climate change; 3) determine the
effectiveness of learning activities on the integration of environmental
pollution materials to anticipate climate change. This research was
classified as quantitative and qualitative research (Mix Method). Data
were collected by means of interviews, observations, documentations and
questionnaires. The results of the research showed that 1) materials of
environmental pollution around students as a source of social studies
learning consisted of water and air pollution that have an impact on
global warming, thus resulting in climate change; 2) environmental
pollution materials were integrated into social studies learning by
reviewing core competencies and basic competencies as outlined in the
lesson plan (RPP) and student worksheets (LKS) with a score of 83%
(valid); 3) Learning activities on environmental pollution materials had
been running more effectively, because of the integration of pollution
cases in the surrounding environment to anticipate climate change. This
was indicated by the significant difference in the results of the
pretest and posttest tests of 0.025 © 2022, Pegem Egitim ve Ogretim

4. M

**Improved?**: Better scores in the environmental awareness
questionnaires

## 81.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: Student’s environmental awareness (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: There might be more than just awareness since the authors
have a discourse about relationships between knowledge, awareness and
actions (p. 56) but the questionnaire is not available. Authors note
that the students are more enthusiastic, because the issues presented
are related to local lives of participants (local environmental issues)
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 81.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “Utilization of the surrounding environment as a
learning resource is able to facilitate students to connect theit
experience with new information” “School may be utilized as a supporting
facility in carrying out environmental education through knowledge,
awareness and attitudes, as well as rational and respondible behavior
towards environmental problems”

**Message to keep:**: The use of local environmental issues as a way to
teach climate change in the context of social studies is something the
authors insisted a lot on.

**title** Multi-Timescale Education Program for Temporal Expansion in
Ecocentric Education: Using Fixed-Point Time-Lapse Images for Phenology
Observation

## 82.1 abstract

Ecocentric education programs should include a method for the in-depth
understanding of multi-scale ecological time concepts. To accomplish
this, the common restriction that ecocentric education should pertain
only to realistic nature may have to be removed. The purpose of this
research was to confirm the validity of a program featuring phenology
observation, employing fixed-point time-lapse images as climate change
learning, and to obtain suggestions on the influence of the program on
the multi-timescale concepts of the learners. An observation sheet
listing images of cherry flowering from 16 April to 15 March each year
from 1996 to 2017 was created, and the 50-min educational program using
the observation sheet was conducted with 189 third year junior high
school students. The tendencies among students’ answers to the two
questions before and after the program suggest that the program
contributed to the students acquiring the hundreds-year timescale
concept based on the short-term timescale concept of dynamic nature. The
contribution of this research is to visualize long-term and multi-scale
ecological time concepts. By combining long-term time-lapse images with
everyday nature experiences, the possibility of expanding such emotions
as wonder and attachment to nature towards a long-term ecological
timescale is achieved.

## 82.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: both

**Type**: environmental education program

**Description**: Using the observation sheet printed on an A3-size
paper, the students attached a red sticker on the day they judged as
“full bloom date,” according to the above-mentioned observation criteria
(Figure 3). This observation work took approximately 15 min out of the
50 min allotted for the entire program. Students were able to grasp the
annual change of flowering phenology by perceiving the red seal similar
to a graph point. At the time, only these 50 min could be secured; thus,
the students themselves did not analyze or consider the relationship
between the full bloom date and the annual temperature. Instead, the
instructor explained that the full bloom date of cherry blossoms was
related to global warming in that it is affected by the temperature
conditions of each year.

## 82.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: NA

**Analysis**: The mean of all the students’ determinations of full bloom
day with a red sticker was calculated. In addition, sample variance and
sample standard deviation were calculated in order to understand how
much variation existed among the students.

**Results**: The 50-min educational program that includes a 15-min plant
phenology observation activity by third-year junior high school students
has provided ecologically appropriate phenology observation results, as
well as the potential for important educational effects regarding
timescale, as described above. the students acquiring the hundreds-year
timescale concept based on the short-term timescale concept of dynamic
nature.

**title** Iḷisaġvik Tribal College’s summer climate program: teaching
STEM concepts to North Slope Alaska high school and middle-school
students

## 83.1 abstract

The incorporation of informal science modules with traditional
ecological knowledge (TEK) engages students in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. During the summers
2012–2015, Iḷisaġvik Tribal College, located in Barrow, AK, hosted an
average of 12 rural Alaska Native middle-school and high school students
per year in the college’s summer STEM program called “Climate and
Permafrost Changes on the North Slope: In Cultural Context.” Teaching
the carbon cycle as a core concept, this 2-week STEM program examined
climate change and its effects on the local landscape from a multitude
of perspectives. Elders shared their observations and experiences
associated with climate change. Local and visiting scientists gave
presentations and taught through games, hands-on laboratory simulations,
and practical field work—all relevant to the camp’s science content.
Pre-assessments and post-assessments using the Student Assessment of
Learning Gains measured student interests and conceptual understanding.
Students developed and enhanced their understanding of science concepts
and, at the end of the camp, could articulate the impact of climactic
changes on their local environment. © 2017, AESS.

**title** Exploring the effects of an environmental education course on
the awareness and perceptions of climate change risks among seventh and
eighth grade learners in South Africa

## 84.1 abstract

Anthropogenic climate change caused by the release of excessive
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere is the biggest
challenge of the 21st century. Man-made climate change threatens the
biosphere on which all forms of life depend. Climate change requires
human effort to manage the impact of extreme events such as droughts,
flooding, and heatwaves. As such, human decision-making processes are
crucial for the successful management of climate change impacts. The
decision-making process include awareness and perception of climate
change risks. Awareness and perceptions of (natural) hazard risk are
determinants of human response (adaptation) to environmental shocks
(climate change and variability). To this end, this study explores the
effects of an environmental education course on the awareness and
perception of climate change risks among seventh and eighth grade
learners in South Africa. This exploratory study collected primary data
through the implementation of emergent participation tools in focus
group discussions with learners (n = 23). These emergent participation
tools are the Problem tree and the Hazard, Impact and Vulnerability
matrix. Responses from a comparison group were juxtaposed with those of
environmental education beneficiaries through a qualitative content
analysis technique. Findings reveal that environmental awareness has an
effect on perceptions of current and future climate change risks.
Learners are concerned about short-term risks more than long-term risks.
Short-term risks such as meeting basic needs and dealing with
criminality are priorities over long-term risks such as climate change.
A daily struggle to meet these basic needs represent the local context
and discourse within which learners view and experience their world.
Learners do perceive the causal linkages between different climatic and
non-climatic risks. Drawing such causal linkages raises awareness and
perception and this cause-effect relationship is necessary for
behavioural change. Environmental education is necessary to raise the
awareness and perceptions of learners to environmental risks such as
climate change. More studies are required to explore the topic of
environmental education on raising awareness and perceptions of
environmental risks such as climate change with head of households.

complete the problem tree exercise by identifying the problems in their
respective communities. They then diagnosed the root causes of their
community problem and the impacts these problems are having on their
communities. Hazard, Impact and Vulnerability matrix this tool enables
the community members to pinpoint hazards, the impact of the hazards,
their vulnerability to their hazards, and scoring these hazards in terms
of the priority to community members. This can be used for vulnerability
assessment, and adaptation assessment. The participant had to decide on
how to score (or not score) each hazard that was identified by the focus
group participants.

## 84.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Focus group, problem tree and Hazard, Impact and Vulnerability
matrix

**Analysis**: Qualitative content analysis techniques.

**Results**: The environmental education group (township participants)
was instructed to complete the hazard, impact and vulnerability matrix
tool on any topic of concern in their local communities(they were not
promoted to discuss environmental risks such as climate change), they
highlighted poverty and damaged infrastructure as risks posed to their
local communities by flooding (Kilinc, Stanisstreet, & Boyes, 2008).
They went further to score risk of flooding alongside “dangerous
taverns” and “drugs” that cause depopulation, mental health problems,
infectious diseases, unwanted pregnancies, and death.

**Improved?**: The group that receive environmental learning had better
understandings of current and future climate change risks

## 84.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: Environmental awareness has an effect on perceptions of
current and future climate change risks. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 84.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The finding suggest that environmental education
affects the perception of linkages between different environmental
hazard risks. Learners were more concerned about short-term risks than
long-term risks. Responses also indicated that short-term risks such as
meeting basic needs and dealing with criminality are priorities over
longterm risks such as climate change. A daily struggle for these basic
needs represent the local context and discourse within which learners
view and experience their world.

**Message to keep:**: Using environmental education could be beneficial
in the awareness and the change of perceptions of the current and future
risks related to climate change

**title** The impact of teenagers’ emotions on their complexity thinking
competence related to climate change and its consequences on their
future: looking at complex interconnections and implications in climate
change education

## 85.1 abstract

This study seeks to address critical gaps in climate change education
research with regard to (1) emotions triggered in teenage students
learning about climate change, (2) the students’ complexity thinking
competence in the context of climate change consequences, and (3) the
interconnections between different types of emotions and the levels of
complexity thinking competence in teenagers’ explanations of climate
change. The study drew on quantitative and qualitative data from 315
(2013-2015) and 246 (2021) teenage secondary school students from a
pre-/post-intervention survey from Austria’s year-long
k.i.d.Z.21-Competent into the Future program, in which almost 3,500
students aged between 13 and 19 have participated up to now. Climate
change triggered expected types of emotions in students. Following
exploratory factor analyses, these were clustered into two groups.
Multilevel modeling revealed that the k.i.d.Z.21-modules had no
influence on teenage students’ levels of complexity thinking competence
in their explanations of climate change for themselves and humanity in
general. The first group of emotions (i.e., angry, sad, helpless,
insecure, worried and inspired to act) was associated with higher levels
of complexity thinking competence in participants’ answers to questions
about climate change and, therefore, designated “stimulation”. The
opposite was true for the second group (i.e., apathetic, annoyed, and
hopeful), which diminished the level of complexity thinking competence
in responses and, therefore, designated “attenuation”. Future studies
are encouraged to draw on the emotion measures developed for this study
to replicate and advance this study’s findings. Educationists are urged
to pay greater attention to emotions in climate change education.

## 85.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study sets out to measure participants’ complexity thinking
competence with regard to climate change consequences on their own lives
and humanity in general.

**Questions**:

1)  emotions triggered in teenage students learning about climate change
2)  the students’ complexity thinking competence in the context of
    climate change consequences
3)  the interconnections between different types of emotions and the
    levels of complexity thinking competence in teenagers’ explanations
    of climate change.

## 85.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: classical school lessons, individual research projects,
conversations, workshops, debates with experts

**Description**: It is a 1 year long intervention within the context of
the school that combines classical approaches like school lessons, with
constructivist methodologies like individual research projects,
conversations, workshops, debates with experts and ends with a final
project.

## 85.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Qualitative and Quantitative

**Analysis**: Multilevel Modeling Analysis

**Results**: revealed that complexity thinking competence is more
pronounced in girls (β = − 0.08, p = 0.017). It increases with the
feeling of stimulation (β = 0.11, p \< 0.001), whereas it decreases with
the feeling of attenuation (β = − 0.13, p \< 0.001). Complexity thinking
competence did not change as a result of the k.i.d.Z.21-interventions (β
= − 0.04, p = 0.208).

**Improved?**: NA

## 85.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Complexity thinking (*Worked?*: No )

**awareness**: awareness of climate change on the environmental,
economic and social challenges of the twenty-first century (*Worked?*:
no )

## 85.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: This study has a very interesting goal which is to
identify the role of emotions and the intervention on awareness (which
requires complexity thinking). They do identify some interesting
relationship but the one-year long intervention was unablet to show
significant results

**title** Raising Students Awareness to Climate Change: An Illustration
With Binding Communication

## 86.1 abstract

Much energy and money is dedicated to increasing climate change
awareness and pro-environmental behaviors. Mere communication campaigns,
which are often alarmist, are widely used despite their uncertain
effectiveness. We suggest that using binding communication strategies
would prove more adequate. Binding communication consists in combining a
persuasive message and a preparatory act linked to the persuasive
message. This procedure is generally reported to be more efficient than
a single persuasive message at influencing attitudes and behavior. This
hypothesis was tested in a study in which students were presented with a
classic climate change communication with/without a preparatory act
(participant-proposed solutions). Results showed that although knowledge
about climate change increased in both conditions, attitudes and
behavior follow-through were positively affected only in the binding
communication condition. Therefore, in addressing climate change and
global warming behaviors, pairing a persuasive message with personal
solution generation is a potentially valid and useful technique.

## 86.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

to change participant’s involvement regarding global warming, which may
not be attainable solely through an increase of information.

**Questions**:

NA

## 86.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: binding communication

**Description**: (a) saw a 1-hr film about climate change, (b) were
invited to discuss the movie for 20 min, and (c) received information on
greenhouse gases and CO2 emission (15 min). The only difference between
the two conditions was that in the “binding communication condition,”
participants were asked to write concrete actions they would be willing
to take to reduce their carbon footprint (approximately for 5 min) at
the end of the intervention.

## 86.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: questionnaire

**Analysis**: reported statistics were adjusted with the
Welch–Satterthwaite equation, and Type II sums of squares were used to
account for the unequal

**Results**: knowledge increased in both control and experimental
conditions, there was a close-to-significant interaction effect between
time and experimental condition on attitudes

**Improved?**: conocimiento mejoro

## 86.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: right or wrong (*Worked?*: yes )

## 86.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: binding communication could be useful for raising young
people’s awareness of climate change and global warming. Even if movies
are able to present information and have been shown to engage their
audience emotionally, our data suggest that fear-appeal-based movies
could be inefficient if not accompanied by concrete solutions.

**title** The Impact of Project Activities on the Cultivation of
Ecological Citizenship in a High School Climate Change Club

## 87.1 abstract

This research explored the characteristics of students’ activities and
their artifacts during their participation in climate change club
projects and investigated the impacts of the club project participation
on students’ ecological citizenship. Climate change club projects were
developed to help students understand climate change, investigate
climate change issues, and plan and participate in social actions.
Participants developed scientific models of causes of climate change and
were expected to develop the own perspectives about socio-scientific
issues related to climate change. Five types of competences of
ecological citizenship were targeted through club activities: knowledge
and understanding, responsibility, justice, sustainability, and
participation. Researchers found activities were student centered and
interactive and artifacts generated by students were resources for
social action. Climate change club activities demonstrated the potential
for student participation in club projects to promote competence for
mitigating climate change among future generations by fostering a new
form of citizenship: ecological citizenship.

## 87.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

1.  What are the characteristics of students’ activities and artifacts
    during climate change club projects?
2.  How do the project activities in a high school climate change club
    affect the cultivation of students’ ecological citizenship?

**Questions**:

NA

## 87.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Club activities consisting in lessons, researches, activities
such as communicating in school and managing waste policies in school

**Description**: Step 1: understanding climate change (2 weeks) -
lessons on climate change - organizing groups of students and
discussions - construction of a model (with drawings) explaining cause
of climate change Step 2: investigating the climate change issues (2
weeks) - investigating $$local and in dayly lives$$ climate change
issues - presentation and discussions of issues from each group Step 3:
planning and participating in social practice (3 weeks) - develop social
practice plan to fight climate change - implementation of practice and
evaluation of activities

## 87.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre- post- questionnaire for ecological citizenship, students
artifact from their activities, field notes and in-depth interviews were
collected. However, it seems that pre- post- questionnaire were mostly
used to prepare the interview which were then analysed.

**Analysis**: Qualitative analyses, note that participant are informed
of the interpretation of their interviews and confirm its
interpretation, an effort is done for triangulation

**Results**: The analyses are qualitative and presented as examples and
overall impression from the researchers, hence difficult to present
here. The authors seem confident that the awareness has improved in
terms of “responsability”, “justice” (global social justice associated
with CC). Concerning knowledge they also say that the students have a
better knowledge of causes and consequences of CC Concerning intention,
while the results seem globally positive they are somewhat contrasted

**Improved?**: Knowledge and awareness improved (concerning knowledge
that is said by the researchers but no clear example are given).
Concerning intention, the results seem to be more contrasted but the
researchers seem to be positive in terms of “sustainability competence
of ecological citizenship”.

## 87.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Understanding causes, impact and characteristics of
climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - responsability: consciousness about the anthropogenic
cause of CC and its consequences for “living and non-living things that
share our ecosystem” - justice: consciousness of the link between global
social justice and CC (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: - Sustainability: changing individual behavior/going from
awareness to pratice/reflexion on usual personal behavior -
Participation: willingness to participate (*Worked?*: Yes/Unclear )

## 87.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: No clear conclusion

**Message to keep:**: An example of student club which raise awareness
of the students, no real surprises or original results. One thing to
keep from it might be that in such high achievement school from Asia,
extracurricular club might be a solution to raise awareness since the
official curricula are not very focused in CC, and the expectation for
results from student do not leave much space for such initiative. Also,
the idea of ecological citizenship and the associated “competences” is
somewhat original

**title** Quality Child–Parent Relationships and Their Impact on
Intergenerational Learning and Multiplier Effects in Climate Change
Education. Are We Bridging the Knowledge–Action Gap?

## 88.1 abstract

The science-education cooperative venture “Our Common Future:
‘eKidZ’-Teach Your Parents Well” explores intergenerational learning
processes and the transfer of learning from the younger to the older
generation. Students acting as multipliers and their multiplication
effect on parents is part of the research setting: 20 high school
students, in the role of researchers, investigated the question of
whether children who participate in the Climate Change Education (CCE)
program “k.i.d.Z.21” passed on their climate-change-related knowledge,
attitudes and actions to their parents (n= 91), in comparison to a
control group (n= 87). Due to the annual increase in student
participants in the CCE project “k.i.d.Z.21” since 2012 (n= 2000), this
article can build on the results of a questionnaire regarding the school
year 2017/18 (n= 100-120). A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
showed that the “k.i.d.Z.21” project has a multi-faceted knock-on effect
on parents, constituting a multiplier effect: increasing knowledge, and,
above all, improvements to the child-parent relationship. Additionally,
measurable positive effects in the frequency and quality of climate
change communication between children and their parents have been
observed (Spearman Rank Correlations), but a distinct lack of positive
effects regarding changing climate-friendly attitudes or actions have
been noted (Pearson Product-Moment Correlation). The importance of the
child-parent relationship is a key factor in bridging the
knowledge-action gap, and is reviewed in the context of CCE.

## 88.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

this paper aims to investigate the findings and results of students’
research regarding intergenerational learning processes and multiplier
effects from the younger to the older generation.

**Questions**:

NA

## 88.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: $$The idea is to compare parents with children
participating to the k.id.z21 CCE program to those with children one
year younger, so difficult to know whether is is curricular or
extracurricular$$

**Indoor/Outdoor**: NA $$The idea is to compare parents with children
participating to the k.id.z21 CCE program to those with children one
year younger, so difficult to know whether is is presential, I guess it
is?$$

**Type**: Children participating in k.i.d.Z.21 CCE project teach, effect
measured on parents

**Description**: We do not have much information on the actual
pedagogical intervention. However the study compare effects on parents
whose children participate on the k.i.d.Z.21 CCE program to those whose
children are one year too young to participate. The k.i.d.Z.21 programme
seems to consist in “annual seminars, research weeks and questionnaire”

## 88.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Questionnaire from which are extracted the factors
“knowledge”, “attitudes”, “action - mobility”, “action - consumption”
and “child parent relationship”. The factor are described but the method
to extract them is not explicited

**Analysis**: After extracting factors “knowledge”, “atttitudes”,
“actions (Mobility)”, “actions (Consumption)” and “child-parent
relationship” from the questionnaire, the statistical procedure MANOVA
was applied to all five factors as dependent variables and the group
experimental/control as independent variable. Direct and interaction
effects were tested. Correlations between factors were also tested.

**Results**: $$KNOWLEDGE$$ the knowledge of the parents of the 8th grade
students $$participating$$ has increase above the knowledge of the
parents of the 7th grade student $$not participating$$ - $$INTENTION$$
(called attitudes) the attitudes of the parents have not changed either
over time nor by the “k.i.d.Z.21” project. - $$HABIT$$ (called actions)
in both cases the actions of the parents have not changed either over
time nor by the “k.i.d.Z.21” project. Extra results: the relationship
$$concerning communication on CC$$ between the children of the 8th grade
and their parents has increased beyond the relationship between the
children of 7th grade and their parents. There is a correlation between
knowledge and attitudes $$intention$$ (not attributable to the
programme, general) and another between knowledge of the parent and
child-parent relationship. Therefore, the effect might be not conclusive
for the project, but there is a possibility of bridging the
knowledge-action gap by intergenerational learning, and a “multiplier
effects” as a result from teaching CC to the children.

**Improved?**: Knowledge of the parents with chidren participating in
the programme has improved, but not intentions nor habits

## 88.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Factor “knowledge” extracted from questions concerning
auto-report of knowledge confidence, and objective questions on cause
and consequences of climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: Factor called “attitudes” by the authors: “mainly consist
of the willingness to behave in a climate-friendly manner. (*Worked?*:
No )

**habit**: Factor called “action” by the authors, divided into mobility
and consumption. It is a mutifaceted factor, coming from various habits.
(*Worked?*: No )

## 88.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Parents mainly gain knowledge $$not attitudes/actions$$
from their children in climate-change-related discussions, whereby the
quality of the child–parent relationship positively influences the
success of intergenerational learning effects. “The correlation between
increasing knowledge and child parent relationship seems to be a
fruitful way to contribute in the research of bridging the
knowledge-action gap.”

**Message to keep:**: Intergenerational learning where children
participating in CCE teach to parents have a clear effect on the
knowledge of the parents, but not in their intention or habits. The
authors show however that the multiplier effect associated with CCE to
children might be useful to bridge the knowledge-action gap, even though
the effect is not as simple as imagined. “The correlation between
increasing knowledge and child parent relationship seems to be a
fruitful way to contribute in the research of bridging the
knowledge-action gap.”

**title** The virtual field trip: Investigating how to optimize
immersive virtual learning in climate change education

## 89.1 abstract

Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) is being used for educational virtual
field trips (VFTs) involving scenarios that may be too difficult,
dangerous or expensive to experience in real life. We implemented an
immersive VFT within the investigation phase of an inquiry-based
learning (IBL) climate change intervention. Students investigated the
consequences of climate change by virtually traveling to Greenland and
exploring albedo and greenhouse effects first hand. A total of 102
seventh and eighth grade students were randomly assigned to one of two
instructional conditions: (1) narrated pretraining followed by IVR
exploration or (2) the same narrated training material integrated within
the IVR exploration. Students in both conditions showed significant
increases in declarative knowledge, self-efficacy, interest, STEM
intentions, outcome expectations and intentions to change behavior from
the pre- to post-assessment. However, there was a significant difference
between conditions favoring the pretraining group on a transfer test
consisting of an oral presentation to a fictitious UN panel. The
findings suggest that educators can choose to present important
prerequisite learning content before or during a VFT. However, adding
pretraining may lead to better transfer test performance, presumably
because it helps reduce cognitive load while learning in IVR.

**title** Assessing students’ learning about fundamental concepts of
climate change under two different conditions

## 90.1 abstract

Students from three different British Columbia grade six classes were
followed through two weeks of instruction on climate change. Pre, post,
and follow-up surveys were used to determine the differences in
knowledge gained and retained by students that received direct
instruction from their science teacher, and by those who received
equivalent content instruction from outside presenters. The teacher
participant also completed a survey on her experience with the
researcher-designed lesson plans. Students’ results on the surveys were
compared to results from a control group with no intervention. The
teacher-based setting resulted in significantly higher knowledge gain,
although no difference was found between the groups’ rate of knowledge
decline thereafter. Highest gains in knowledge were for the carbon cycle
and the human impacts topic, followed by understanding the difference
between climate and weather. The students and teacher alike appeared to
struggle with the topic of global warming and the greenhouse effect. The
research suggests that with the appropriate background information the
classroom teacher is likely to be more effective at conveying the
science of climate change, particularly when it is taught through an
understanding of the carbon cycle and its human impacts. It also
suggests that those non-governmental organizations engaged in climate
change education might be better served by investing their limited
resources in the development of learning materials and subsequent
professional development for teachers rather than focusing on in-school
presentations.

**Conclusions**: that this timeframe was sufficient for students to make
substantive knowledge gains in three fundamen- tal areas: (a) weather
and climate; (b) the carbon cycle and the human impacts; and (c) global
warming and the greenhouse effect.

**Message to keep:**: Many teachers are uncomfortable instructing on
climate change and global warming because they feel that they do not
possess the necessary background information on the subject as they
themselves received little if any instruction on it. This research
supports the idea that with the necessary background information, the
classroom teacher is more effective than the pre- senters who have
substantially more experience educating on the topic, but less
experience teaching in the classroom.

**title** Experimentation with a socio- constructivist process for
climate change education

## 91.1 abstract

A socio-constructivist and experiential process for climate change
education was experimented within two coastal communities of Eastern
Canada with 39 students 13 and 14 years of age. The pedagogical process,
based on local observation of climate change, Duit’s conceptual change
theory (1999) and experiential learning, aimed for the improvement of
students’ conceptions of climate change: the nature of the phenomenon,
its signs, causes, consequences and remedial actions as well as the
possibility of mobilizing the population in reducing its impact on
climate. Initial and final interviews with the young adolescents
indicated an improvement in students’ ideas about climate change’s
diverse dimensions. However, the students expressed their uncertainty
regarding the adults’ ability to change their behaviour. Students also
identified educational activities that helped improve their conceptions.

## 91.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The object of the research was to verify if the proposed pedagogical
process would succeed in improving students’ conceptions on climate
change: explanation of the phenomenon, its causes, signs, consequences,
possible human actions and possibilities that the general popu- lation
will mobilize to minimize their impact on the climate.

**Questions**:

Has the local and experiential socio-constructivist process proposed in
September 2000 to educate teenagers about climate change provoked
conceptual change in students?

## 91.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Experiential learning

**Description**: • detailed and critical observation of a beach and
representation of beach components on a map (students portrayed the
plants and animals found on the beach as well as the undesirable
elements—contaminants found at this place); • information on the
greenhouse effect with the help of a simplified diagram of the
phenomenon (diagram of the phenomenon and identification of the main
greenhouse gases); • observation of possible signs of climate change in
the milieu by asking their parents about these signs. Video on the
consequences of a recent storm that had brought enormous blocks of ice
to the coast and flooded residences; • work in teams of four to five
students. Students played the roles of meteorologists, chemists,
ecologists, doctors or urban planners (according to their choice) to
study the environment’s current situation and predict what could happen
through climate change.

## 91.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Questionnaires

**Analysis**: Interviews and questionnaires

**Results**: Knowledge and awareness increased but intention is not
clear: fatalism seem to predominate (no possibility to mobilize)

**Improved?**: improvement of students’ conceptions of climate change:
the nature of the phenomenon, its signs, causes, consequences and
remedial actions as well as the possibility of mobilizing the population
in reducing its impact on climate.

## 91.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Yes (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Yes (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: Yes (*Worked?*: No )

## 91.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: After experiential socio-constructivist process,
students improved their knowledge of causes, impacts and solutions
related to climate change. Awareness was mostly improved through field
trip (i.e. beach outing), working with scientists and university
conference. Graphic representations of the greenhouse effect seem to
help. Fatalism (impossibility that adult’s behaviour change) and
nihilism (climate change is very difficult to influence) could be
unintentionnally transmitted to the students which is likely
counterproductive

**title** The Process of Change Experimented by Teachers and Students
when Voluntarily Trying Environmental Behaviors

## 92.1 abstract

During a training program on climate change education, teachers were
invited to experiment with environmental behaviors in their personal
lives. They then created their own climate change education model, with
which they experimented in their classroom. Through teachers’ and
students’ work, individual interviews, and questionnaires, researchers
monitored the behavioral change process of 25 teachers and of 75
students who participated in the pedagogical activities planned by the
teachers. Motivational factors included a profound attachment to the
natural environment and a desire to help the Earth. Facilitating factors
included participation in a support group, the simplicity of chosen
actions, and encouragement from family members. Limiting factors
included time, the lack of awareness in one’s surroundings,
forgetfulness, and fatigue. The theory put forward by Prochaska,
Norcross, and DiClemente (2002) was used to interpret the results and
propose pedagogical interventions in climate change education. © Taylor

## 92.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Present the process of behavioural change of both teachers and students,
analyzing it in light of Prochaska, Norcross and DiClemente’s theory
(2002), and we recom- mend pedagogical strategies for climate change
education.

**Questions**:

NA

## 92.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular (students) and professional
development (teachers)

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: climate change behaviors’ trial

**Description**: 25 participating teachers were chosen at random and
individually interviewed two month after the start of the trial period.
Open ended questions were aimed at making them recount their personal
experience during the attempt at change. 75 students were interrogated
two months after the start of their new behaviors’ trial period.

## 92.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: NA

**Analysis**: content analysis of questionnaires; subjective
interpretation

**Results**: NA

**Improved?**: Unclear

## 92.6 Outcomes

**action**: Yes (*Worked?*: Unclear )

## 92.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: Engage people in changing some behaviours can
strengthen the effectivity; the first reason to act evoked by teachers
and stu- dents was not worry about the impacts of cli- mate change, but
rather a renewed attachment to nature and a sincere preoccupation for
the general state of the environment. The creation of social norms
favorable to environmental ac- tion in changing communities appears to
hold promise.

**title** When Teachers Adopt Environmental Behaviors in the Aim of
Protecting the Climate

## 93.1 abstract

The authors invited teachers participating in a climate change education
course to voluntarily demonstrate new environmental behaviors. They were
interviewed and described the process of change they experienced.
Facilitating professional development activities were participation in a
community of change, construction of knowledge of climate change, a solo
activity in nature, and a continuum of values. Organizational skills,
personal advantages, and ease of chosen actions were facilitating
factors. Limiting factors included lack of time and lack of awareness of
people around them and the difficulty of affirming one’s differences.
Participants experienced positive feelings in their process, except for
guilt when they forgot to do the new actions. © 2006 Heldref

## 93.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This project’s goal is “to describe in more depth teachers’ behavior
change processes when they started their attempts at environmental
behaviors.

**Questions**:

what are the factors promoting and limiting new actions, 2. the
training’s motivational elements, and 3. the feelings experi- enced
during the trial period

## 93.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: NA

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: The Mutants’ Circle (the term mutant refers to any person who
chooses to adopt new behaviors to reduce his or her impact on the
climate)

**Description**: Two major types of activities. First, knowledge
transmission and construction activities were centered on climate
change—its nature, signs, causes, and possible local consequences.
Second, experiential and affective activities followed, including
science experiments, a moment of solitude in nature (solo),
role-playing, values activities, and field trips. Throughout the
training period, we gave particular emphasis to sharing among peers to
create a sense of community. Also, During the first weekend of training,
all teachers decided on their own to experiment with one or two new
behaviors to reduce their impact on the climate

## 93.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Interviews; self report of behavioral change

**Analysis**: Interviews were written in narrative (a structured
synopsis of remarks collected during an interview). In paralel,
interviews were analized creating and counting emergent categories. One
team researcher did this analysis, and the results were linked to the
narratives (triangulation). Researchers identified behaviors chosen by
the teachers, their degree of success in achieving those behaviors,
factors promoting and limiting new actions, the training’s motivational
elements, and the feelings experienced during the trial period.

**Results**: According to author’s report, the most successful behaviors
were water economy (5 participants of 7), judicious automobile use (4
participants of 6), paper towel use reduction (5 participants of 5), and
use of reusable containers in lunchboxes (2 participants of 3). Aspects
facilitating behavioral change were mainly two: being part of a
community had reinforced the idea that individual behaviors can truly
make a difference, even if the actions are minimal. Second, having heard
people in their group talk of actions they were already accomplishing
incited them to imitate those people.

**Improved?**: NA

## 93.6 Outcomes

**habit**: yes (*Worked?*: unclear, there is no baseline )

**other**: Aspects facilitating behavioral change (*Worked?*: NA )

## 93.7 Conclusions

**title** The effects of teacher-led class interventions during
technology-enhanced science inquiry on students’ knowledge integration
and basic need satisfaction

## 94.1 abstract

This study investigated the effects of two differently designed
classroom scripts that guided the teacher-led interventions during the
courses of the WISE Climate Change project. 168 students from 10 classes
were randomly assigned to either the high-structured condition (teacher
interventions on group level and on class level) or the low-structured
condition (only teacher interventions on group level). Effects were
measured on students’ knowledge integration and students’ need
satisfaction. The results did not provide evidence that the
high-structured condition leads to higher learning gains, yet it was
found that pausing the group work during computer-supported
collaborative learning (CSCL) to provide structure and feedback by the
teacher at a whole-classroom plenary level significantly lowered the
feelings of competence frustration. Especially low prior knowledge
students expressed higher competence frustration in the low-structured
condition. These findings suggest to blend CSCL with teacher-led class
interventions to optimize the learning environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier

**title** Primary School Student Teachers’ Understanding of Climate
Change: Comparing the Results Given by Concept Maps and Communication
Analysis

## 95.1 abstract

Climate change is a complex environmental problem that can be used to
examine students’ understanding, gained through classroom communication,
of climate change and its interactions. The present study examines a
series of four science sessions given to a group of primary school
student teachers (n = 20). This includes analysis of the communication
styles used and the students’ pre- and post-conceptualisation of climate
change based on results obtained via essay writing and drawings. The
essays and drawings concerned the students’ unprompted pre- and
post-conceptions about climate change, collected before and after each
of the four inquiry-based science sessions (in physics, chemistry,
biology and geography). Concept mapping was used in the analysis of the
students’ responses. The communication used in the four sessions was
analysed with a communicative approach in order to find out the
discussion about climate change between teacher and students. The
analyses indicated that the students did not have the knowledge or the
courage to participate in discussion, but post-conceptualisation map
showed that students’ thinking had become more coherent after the four
sessions. Given the results of the present study, proposals for using
concepts maps and/or communication analysis in studying students’
conceptions are presented.

## 95.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: Climate change education is challenging to
teachers because it is an issue characterized by controversy,
uncertainty, interdisciplinarity and complexity. Learners find it
difficult to understand climate change because abstract processes and
concepts are involved. Without inquiry, students cannot gain a relevant
concept for their knowledge construction, attention should be paid to
the forms of commu- nication: Learners should be active and motivated to
join discussions. Students usually do not have the knowledge or courage
to participate in discussion, but post-conceptualisation map showed that
students’ thinking had become more coherent. Paper also demonstrates
that climate change education can be integrated to any science
discipline

**title** Improving students’ conceptual understanding of the greenhouse
effect using theory-based learning materials that promote deep learning

## 96.1 abstract

Students everyday ideas of the greenhouse effect are difficult to
change. Environmental education faces the challenge of developing
instructional settings that foster students conceptual understanding
concept of the greenhouse effect in order to understand global warming.
To facilitate students conceptual development with regard to the
greenhouse effect, learning materials aimed at promoting active
cognitive learning in order to achieve deep understanding were designed.
The learning materials were developed on the basis of the theory of
reasoning and understanding co-founded by the Swiss educational
psychologist Aebli. In a repeated measure design using a pre-, post- and
follow-up test, the efficacy of these learning materials compared with
standard learning materials was tested. A total of 289 eighth graders
who had received little prior science instruction participated in the
study. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to
examine the students knowledge acquisition and understanding over three
measurement times. The group that had been instructed according to the
method aimed at in-depth learning outperformed the group taught with
standard materials on subsequent tests in terms of knowledge gains,
structure and retention. The findings suggest that the theory-based
learning materials promote active cognitive processing during learning.
The instructional design of the learning materials seems to engage the
learners in high cognitive activities that facilitate deep conceptual
understanding of the complex and abstract concept of the greenhouse
effect. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

## 96.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Deternine effects of optimized and conventional learning environments on
several aspects of understanding of greenhouse effect (holistic
conception, knowledge about CO2, radiation conversion, multilevel
statements).

**Questions**:

6 items per subscale. Answered in a Likert scale. Pre- and post- open
ended questions and sketches reflecting student’s understanding on the
greenhouse effect.

## 96.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Two experimental groups: - gp1: Optimised learning environment
based on worksheets based on psychological didactics. - gp2: Standard
learning environment Control group: No instruction

**Description**: Both experimental groups: - Pre-intervention
questionnaire. - Worksheet work on greenhouse effects and its causes.
Includes discussion of the content in pairs of students. Each
experimental group separately: - Reasoning on an imagined experiment on
the effects of athmosphere composition on greenhouse effects (two
different learning environments, one for each experimental group:
optimised vs standard). - Both experiments run by students and results
are observed. Both groups: - Recall of procedures and what they
learned. - Problem-solving transfer questions. - post- intervention
questionnaire. Control group only completed pre- and post-
questionnaires with no greenhouse instruction.

## 96.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Scales (pre-, post-) and open-ended questions/ sketches.

**Analysis**: Mixed effects ANOVAs (group X pre, post and follow-up).

**Results**: All outcomes showed expected differences (congrol vs both
experimental groups) and are maintained across time.

**Improved?**: All sub scales worked (Athmosphere hole, knowledge of CO2
emission, radiation conversion and multilevel statements).

## 96.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Yes, both experimental groups showed better understanding
of CC and its ink to CO2 emissions compared to control group. No
difference between experimental groups. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 96.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Intervention worked and effects were stable across a
moderate amount of time.

**Message to keep:**: Both learning environments interventions worked in
the intended direction and showed effects lasting across time. Enhanced
pedagogy did not show an effect though.

**title** Shallow strategy development in a teachable agent environment
designed to support self-regulated learning

## 97.1 abstract

To support self-regulated learning (SRL), computer-based learning
environments (CBLEs) are often designed to be open-ended and
multidimensional. These systems incorporate diverse features that allow
students to enact and reveal their SRL strategies via the choices they
make. However, research shows that students’ use of such features is
limited; students often neglect SRL-supportive tools in CBLEs. In this
study, we examined middle school students’ feature use and strategy
development over time using a teachable agent system called Betty’s
Brain. Students learned about climate change and thermoregulation in two
units spanning several weeks. Learning was assessed using a
pretest-posttest design, and students’ interactions with the system were
logged. Results indicated that use of SRL-supportive tools was
positively correlated with learning outcomes. However, promising
strategy patterns weakened over time due to shallow strategy
development, which also negatively impacted the efficacy of the system.
Although students seemed to acquire one beneficial strategy, they did so
at the cost of other beneficial strategies. Understanding this
phenomenon may be a key avenue for future research on SRI-supportive
CBLEs. We consider two hypotheses for explaining and perhaps reducing
shallow strategy development: a student-centered hypothesis related to
“gaming the system,” and a design-centered hypothesis regarding how
students are scaffolded via the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

## 97.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Assessment of how schoolchildren learn using self-regulated
learning-supportive tools, what are the student’s interactions with the
tool and the factors of learning effectiveness

**Questions**:

What features are used most frequently and what features are neglected?
What features are associated with learning gains in terms of knowledge
and understanding of the domain? How does feature use change over time
(i.e., from one unit to a later unit)?

## 97.4 Intervention

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: computer-based learning environments

**Description**: Use of teachable agent system called Betty’s Brain.

## 97.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Tool outputs

**Analysis**: Statistics pre-post tests

**Results**: Students who monitored the content and quality of their
maps, and used such information to guide map generation, showed larger
gains on learning assessments and constructed higher-quality maps.
Negative impact on the mid term, which negatively impacted the efficacy
of the system.

**Improved?**: overall disappointing learning gains,

## 97.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Yes (*Worked?*: Unclear )

**awareness**: Yes (*Worked?*: unclear )

## 97.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: This computer-based learning environment (CBLE)
called Betty’s brain has “disappointing learning gains” and scores
weakened over time along with less use of all tool functionalities
(“students’ feature use in SRL-supportive CBLEs appears limited”).
Students did not become better at causal reasoning using the tool. An
insufficiently scaffolded CBLE will likely exacerbate students’ tendency
to “game” that system.

**title** The Need to Introduce System Thinking in Teaching Climate
Change

## 98.1 abstract

Research related to teaching climate change, system thinking, current
reform in science education, and the research on reform-oriented
assessment indicate that we need to explore student understanding in
greater detail instead of only testing for an incremental gain in
disciplinary knowledge. Using open-ended items we assessed details in
student successes and challenges in thinking about climate change and
climate system. Twelve teachers of the 7th and 8th grades and 457
students from four schools in a Midwestern state participated in this
study. Statistical analysis of student responses on the pre- and
post-test showed a significant (p\<0.0001) gain in knowledge but more
importantly, qualitative analysis of student responses showed that they
learned that our climate is changing but had constructed a linear
connection between variables such as surface temperature and drought.
The students did not develop a connected body of knowledge or an
understanding of climate as a system. Future research needs to focus on
curriculum development, effective system pedagogy, assessment, and
teacher development in the context of climate change as an interlinked
system.

**title** Development a Prototype Environmental Education Teacher
through PAIC Process

## 99.1 abstract

The objective of this study was to develop a prototype of environmental
education teacher through PAIC process. Sample group was selected by
purposive sampling technique based on the defined criteria. The
methodology was implemented with
Participatory-Appreciation-lnfluence-Control (PAIC) integrated with
brain-storming and focus group discussion for developing trainer (TOT)
to be a prototype. The research results illustrated that after PAIC
process implemented, the mean scores of posttest of knowledge of
Environmental Education (EE), knowledge of global warming,
characteristics of Environmental Education Teacher (EET), inspiration of
environmental conservation, environmental behavior, and training
achievement were higher than pretest with statistical significance
(p\<.01, p\<.01, p\<.01, p\<.01, p\<.01, and p\<.01) respectively.
Furthermore, FDE was used for trainer role play evaluation, it
illustrated that Trainer Self-Evaluation, Audience Evaluation, Trainer
Friend-Evaluation and Expert Trainer-Evaluation were no differences
among four dimensional aspects of evaluation, then the 10 selected
scientific teachers with top ten highest scores to be trainers. One-way
ANOVA was used investigate the mean scores difference of four groups.
The results of One-way ANOVA showed that there were difference of mean
scores on role play as trainer in training process (p\>.05). The 10
trained scientific teachers would be prototype of EET trainers and the
left participants would be facilitators for the second level and they
acted as steering committee to organize the second level training with
the aid of researcher team.

**title** Innovation in the teaching-learning process of global climate
change through the collaborative wall

## 100.1 abstract

The aim of this mixed research is to analyze the students’ perception
about the use of the collaborative wall in the educational process of
global climate change considering data science. The collaborative wall
is a web application that allows the active participation of students
and discussion of ideas in the classroom. During the face-to-face
sessions, the students use mobile devices to share the information and
images of the courses through the collaborative wall. The sample is made
up of 74 students from the National Preparatory School No. 7 “Ezequiel
A. Chávez” who took the Biology IV course during the 2019 school year.
The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that the
organization of ideas and dissemination of information in the
collaborative wall positively influence the learning process of global
climate change, motivation and interest of the students. Data science
identifies 6 predictive models about the use of the collaborative wall
in the field of Biology through the decision tree technique. In fact,
the use of the collaborative wall in the Biology IV course facilitated
the assimilation of knowledge about the global climate change and
improved the active participation of the students in the classroom.
Finally, the collaborative wall allows the creation of new educational
spaces where students acquire the main role during the learning process.

## 102.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This research aims to investigate the effects of an exhibition visit on
pre-service elementary teachers’ understandings of climate change.

**Questions**:

1.  To what extent did the exhibition visit embedded within the
    environmental education program affect pre-service elementary
    teachers’ understandings of climate change?
2.  How did the EE course affect the participants’ understandings of
    climate change?
3.  Was there any significant difference between the understandings of
    participants who attended the exhibition and those who did not?

## 102.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Basic concepts and participation on a exhibition visit

**Description**: During the first five weeks, basic concepts and
information about ecology and the historical development and causes of
environmental problems were introduced. During the next five weeks,
worked in groups (with three or four members) to prepare and deliver
presentations about current environmental problems as listed below. 1.
Water pollution 2. Air pollution 3. Soil pollution and erosion 4.
Radioactive pollution 5. The depletion of the ozone layer 6. The loss of
biological diversity 7. Waste 8. Energy 9. Hormone-injected foods and
genetically modified organisms 10. Global warming. At the beginning of
the term, the pre-service teachers submitted pre-reflections on the
issue of climate change. After the presentations, the participants
attended an exhibition about climate change. Participation in the
exhibition visit was voluntary, but all participants were required to
submit their post-reflection on climate change at the end of the term.
The main purpose of the exhibition was to increase attendees’ awareness
and knowledge about climate change.

## 102.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre-and post-reflections

**Analysis**: Various codes emerged from the participants’ explanations
for the definitions, causes, and consequences of climate change, and
their suggestions for possible solutions. The McNemar test was used to
analyze the codes that emerged from the participants’ pre- and
post-reflections. The McNemar test was used to analyze the codes that
emerged from the participants’ pre- and post-reflections.

**Results**: Table 5 shows the statistically significant results of the
changes in pre-service elementary teachers’ understandings of climate
change throughout the course for those who attended the exhibition and
those who did not, with a .05 confidence interval. It was found that the
EE course resulted in significant changes in specified categories for
both visitors and non-visitors to the exhibition.

**Improved?**: Better understanding of climate change

## 102.6 Outcomes

**other**: The effects of an exhibition visit on the understanding of
climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 102.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The results of this study revealed that the EE course,
with its focus on various environmental problems, seems to have had an
impact on pre-service elementary teachers’ understandings of climate
change. Throughout the course they also improved their understandings
about reducing and coping with climate change, including the use of
renewable energy sources, public transportation, and the importance of
individual effort.

**Message to keep:**: Using different approaches to understand climate
change is recommend. This study findings support the idea that the use
of outdoor activities (e.g. exhibition visit) could bring to the
teachers more information and promixity to the climate change issue.

**title** Potential of ‘future workshop’ method for educating
adolescents about climate change mitigation and adaptation: a case from
Freistadt, Upper Austria

## 103.1 abstract

Using the ‘future workshop’ (FW) method, adolescents can be prepared for
responding to climate-related risks at the local level. The
‘KLAR!–Zukunftswerkstatt’ presents a case study combining climate change
information, FW and place-attachment theories. Its development and
application with 41 learners in one upper-secondary school in Austria
are demonstrated. Statistically significant findings suggest that
students are more aware about mitigation and adaptation behaviors after
participating in FW. Qualitative findings demonstrate that students
developed higher levels of action knowledge for mitigation and
adaptation behaviors. Such teaching approach is not limited to the
researched case, but supports environmental education in general. © 2020

## 103.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

- Examining whether such educational intervention $$Future workshop$$
  could raise upper-secondary school students’ levels of awareness of
  mitigation and adaptation
- Examining the effect of ‘KLAR! – Zukunftswerkstatt’ on upper-secondary
  school students’ action knowledge for climate change mitigation and
  adaptation behaviors?

**Questions**:

NA

## 103.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Worshop consisting of lessons, investigation, and proposal
from the students

**Description**: Based on the “future workshop” method, the intervention
consisted in a student centered activity in which students worked in
small groups structured on 5 phase: - preparation phase (50 min):
researchers developed learning content about climate-related risks in
Muehlviertel region and established common rules for collaboration
between researchers and students. - Critique phase (200 min): students
were invited to investigate current and projected climate-related risks
in regional human and natural systems using material from the Austrian
Assessment Report Climate Change 2014 (APCC, 2014) and other sources. -
Fantasy phase (200 min): students developed their own ideas, a theorized
future in which carbon emissions are reduced and adaptation to
climate-related risks is enhanced - Implementation phase (200 min):
participants identified meaningful climate solutions for their home
region and they discussed their personal roles for increased climate
action - Follow-up phase(200 min): final sham event in which students
presented their outcomes to their school and community

## 103.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Questionnaire with quantitative (likert, awareness) and
qualitative questions (free text, knowledge and intention)

**Analysis**: One-tailed wilcoxon signed rank test on awareness (likert)
questions, effect size are also calculated (Cohen r) - qualitative
content analysis on questions where students had to redact test

**Results**: $$AWARENESS$$: Signicative (p\<0.001) differences (pre vs
post) with large effect size for awareness on importance of mitigation
strategies, Signicative (p\<0.01) differences with medium effect size on
the importance of adaptation strategies $$Action-knowledge (KNOWLEDGE +
INTENTION)$$ : More mitigation strategies cited in post test in the
qualitative content analysis. More adaptation strategies cited in the
post-test in the qualitative content analysis. Note: here as well, when
compared, students seem to have more difficulties integrating adaptation
strategies than mitigation ones

**Improved?**: Awareness about importance of local mitigation/adaptation
strategies improved Action-knowledge (knowledge + intention) about the
implementation and specific strategies improved

## 103.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Knowledge about specific strategies for mitigation and
adaptation (e.g. transport, diet, consumption) (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: How important is that people of the region contribute to
mitigation and adaptation? (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: “Action-knowledge” and personal/comunity role in local
mitigation and adaptation (*Worked?*: Unclear )

## 103.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “Future workshop” methodology raised awareness and
action-knowledge about local mitigation and adaptation strategies, and
should be used for other environmental issues. “Educators are
specifically encouraged to frame climate change as a cultural challenge
instead of a purely scientific or technocratic one.”

**Message to keep:**: Future workshop, with place-based research and
proposal of the students raised awareness and action-knowledge about
local mitigation and adaptation strategies. Authors insist on the fact
that mitigation is easier for the students to integrate than adaptation.
Framing climate change as a cultural challenge instead of a purely
technical one is encouraged

**title** Debunking Climate Myths Is Easy—Is It Really? An Explorative
Case Study with Pre-Service Physics Teachers

## 104.1 abstract

Climate change is a complex topic and hence makes teaching climate
change a demanding task. This is especially because climate change still
represents a (socially) controversial topic and students may be
confronted with misrepresentations and misinformation about climate
change in their daily lives. Therefore, it is important that science
teachers are equipped with skills to properly respond to or “debunk”
climate change misinformation, and to train their students on how to
identify and respond to misinformation. To address this, we developed an
intervention based on inoculation theory and known debunking techniques
to foster physics pre-service teachers’ debunking skills as well as
their self-efficacy to confront climate misinformation. Through the
intervention, we showed that the participants increased their debunking
skills and they showed more accurate assessments of their own skills. We
conclude that this approach is promising to foster pre-service teachers’
perceived competence to teach the demanding topic of climate change.
Finally, our approach generally shows potential in preparing future
teachers to teach other controversial topics where misinformation is
abundant.

## 104.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To improve physics pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) skills to debunk climate
change misinformation and to apply ideas of inoculation theory in their
future teaching

**Questions**:

1.  Does an intervention based on active inoculation and debunking tasks
    in the context of climate change contribute to an increase in
    physics pre-service teachers’ perceived knowledge about climate
    change?
2.  Does an intervention based on active inoculation and debunking tasks
    contribute to an increase in physics pre-service teachers’ debunking
    skills?
3.  Does an intervention based on active inoculation and debunking tasks
    contribute to an increase in the participating physics pre-service
    teachers’ climate myth debunking self-efficacy?
4.  How do students evaluate the learning environment based on active
    inoculation and debunking?

## 104.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: educational experience

**Description**: The preservice physics teachers filled in a
questionnaire on demographics, climate change beliefs, and their
perceived knowledge about climate change. Furthermore, they completed a
debunking task to measure their PSTs’ debunking skills. Additionally, we
measured the PSTs’ climate myth debunking self-efficacy before and after
completion of the debunking task as part of the measurement.

## 104.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test / post-test compared statistically with paired
t-tests

**Analysis**: NA

**Results**: Through the intervention, we showed that the participants
increased their debunking skills and they showed more accurate
assessments of their own skills.

**Improved?**: understanding improved

## 104.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increased knowledge (*Worked?*: yes )

**awareness**: yes (*Worked?*: yes )

## 104.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: We conclude that this approach is promising to foster
pre-service teachers’ perceived competence to teach the demanding topic
of climate change

**Message to keep:**: we have shown that our debunking task, using real
world climate change misinformation, is a feasible approach to measuring
debunking skills. We want to encourage future studies to investigate
other approaches to foster the development of debunking skills by using
similar measurements. Furthermore, the relationship between conceptual
understandings or attitudinal beliefs and PSTs’ debunking skills should
especially be investigated in future studies.

## 105.1 abstract

Nine 11th and 12th grade students from a large urban high school
participated in a three-tiered program that charged them with the
responsibility to be earth science mentors for 7th graders from a local
feeder school. During Tier I, a three-month training period, these 11th
and 12th graders worked closely with university-based scientists,
science educators, and secondary science teachers to learn a tested
curriculum on climate change and to prepare to be mentors. Prior to Tier
I, four scientists involved in climate change research were asked to
derive independently a list of concepts that they perceived to be most
central to this topic. A concept mapping exercise was developed from
their consensus and, both at the beginning and at the end of Tier I,
student understandings were analyzed with concept maps and interviews. A
baseline of 11th and 12th grade students’ understandings of climate
change is established and suggestions are made as to how these findings
can inform instructional practices in the geosciences.

## 105.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Prepare a diverse population of 11th and 12th grade students from a
large urban high school in the Midwest to mentor 7th graders from a
local feeder school.

**Questions**:

NA

## 105.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Summer workshop

**Description**: During Tier I, nine 11th and 12th grade students were
split into four groups of two-to-three students each. During a one-week
intensive summer workshop, each group was assigned to a certain aspect
of climate change and then collaborated with the other groups to help
them understand their topic. After the workshop, members of a
university-based team consisting of university scientists and science
educators, and secondary science teachers, continued to scaffold the
11th and 12th grade students on a weekly basis over the course of two
months to help them prepare for Tier II an Tier III. During Tier II, the
11th and 12th grade students visited a feeder middle school
approximately three times a week for five weeks where they facilitated a
unit on climate change for 7th grade middle school students. During Tier
III, the 11th and 12th grade student mentors worked with the 7th grade
students to prepare and present a traveling exhibit to other 7th grade
students. Both the 7th and 11th and 12th grade students continued to be
supported by the university-based team throughout Tier II and Tier III.

## 105.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Concept maps and interviews

**Analysis**: Representation analysis

**Results**: The findings suggest that even when 11th and 12th grade
students are able to perform certain assessment tasks in a school
environment, their success on a task does not automatically indicate
whether or not students will be able to clearly demonstrate
understanding in an authentic situation. The use of both a concept map
exercise and interviews allowed us to create a setting where students
were encouraged to explore ideas and verbally articulate their
understandings.

**Improved?**: Students involved in the summer workshop use new concepts
to describe the climate change based on ths scientific knowledge

## 105.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Learn the basic concepts and teach them as peers to other
students (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Be aware of climate change and its related concepts
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 105.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: This article presents an strategy in which
students can become teachers of their peers. The most important issue is
the creation of a collaborative learning using mentoring, coaching and
modeling, on the base of scientific concepts and knowledge related to
climate change. The authors remark the importance of the work between
scientist, teachers and learners.

**title** Climate change education: quantitatively assessing the impact
of a botanical garden as an informal learning environment

## 106.1 abstract

Although informal learning environments have been studied extensively,
ours is one of the first studies to quantitatively assess the impact of
learning in botanical gardens on students’ cognitive achievement. We
observed a group of 10th graders participating in a one-day educational
intervention on climate change implemented in a botanical garden. The
students completed multiple-choice questionnaires in a
pre-post-retention test design. Comparing the test scores revealed a
significant short-term knowledge gain as well as a long-term knowledge
gain. Consequently, our results show the potentials of botanical gardens
as effective learning environments, and for complementing formal
school-based learning settings regarding climate change education.

## 106.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Evaluate whether botanical gardens can serve as effective educational
institutions with regard to the issue of climate change.

**Questions**:

Can participation in a one-day environmental education intervention in a
botanical garden enhance students’ knowledge on climate change? If there
is a knowledge gain, will it be persistent over a long period of time?

## 106.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: outdoor

**Type**: Intervention comprised of two learning units: the first one
provided background information about the issue of climate change by
learning at workstations

**Description**: NA

## 106.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre post test and cohen´s and Cronbach’s

**Analysis**: NA

**Results**: Comparing the test scores revealed a significant short-term
knowledge gain as well as a long-term knowledge gain.

**Improved?**: The implemented knowledge scale showed a high
reliability, with Cronbach’s. The inner-group comparison of the pre-test
and post-test knowledge scores (short-term) revealed a significant
increase for the treatment group. Comparing the pre-test and retention
test scores (long-term), we observed significantly higher knowledge
scores for the retention test. The post- and retention test scoresdid
not differ (persistence).

## 106.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increased knowledge (*Worked?*: yes )

## 106.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The environmental education on climate change in
botanical gardens cannot substitute for classroom instruction. It may
provide a valuable addition to classroom instruction if the content is
already addressed in the syllabi. If not, botanical gardens may even
serve as the only suitable source of knowledge for students as it was
the case in our study. Botanical gardens provide ideal preconditions for
climate change education as they offer the opportunity to combine the
biological and geographical aspects of the issue. In summary, we assume
botanical gardens to be ideal sites for environmental education on
global climate change and our results indicate that they are as
effective as other out-of-school settings.

**Message to keep:**: The environmental education on climate change in
botanical gardens cannot substitute for classroom instruction. It may
provide a valuable addition to classroom instruction if the content is
already addressed in the syllabi. If not, botanical gardens may even
serve as the only suitable source of knowledge for students

**title** Effects of a 1-day environmental education intervention on
environmental attitudes and connectedness with nature

## 107.1 abstract

Besides cognitive learning effects, short-term environmental education
(EE) is often regarded as ineffective in intervening with participants’
environmental attitudes and behaviour. However, in Germany, school
classes often participate in such 1-day EE programmes because they
better match the school curriculum in contrast to longer (residential)
programmes. We therefore monitored a 1-day outreach EE programme on
global climate change to reveal whether environmental attitudes and/or
connectedness with nature of tenth graders are affected. Students from
German high schools (college preparatory secondary school level,
‘Gymnasium’) (N0114) from age 14 to 19 participated in the programme
(treatment group). It consisted of two student-centred learning units on
the topic of climate change. Additionally, we chose a control group of
students who did not participate in the programme. To measure students’
environmental attitudes and connectedness with nature, we administered
the Two Major Environmental Values (2-MEV) and the Inclusion of Nature
in Self scale in a pre-, post- and retention test design. The pre-test
was administered 1 week before, the post-test directly after and the
retention test 4 to 6 weeks after programme participation. Analyses
revealed a positive long-term effect only for utilitarian values (one of
the two major environmental factors of 2-MEV) which decreased
significantly. Therefore, depending on the programme’s content,
short-term EE programmes indeed may have an influence on participants’
environmental attitudes. © Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada,

## 107.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Observe effect of a short, 1-day outreach EE programme on global climate
change on environmental attitudes and/or connectedness with nature.

**Questions**:

Two major environmental values scale (2-MEV) and Inclusion of Self in
Nature (ISN).

## 107.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Outdoor

**Type**: Two learning modules in an ecological-botanical garden.

**Description**: Two interventions: 1: 8 (and one optional) workstations
in a seminar room. Up to four children had to solve tasks as presented
in a workbook in each workstations. Tasks dealt with climate modelling,
policy, energy savings, effect of CC in ecosystems, CC and earth’s
history and greehouse gasses. Theory heavy. 2: In the public gardens and
greenhouses students were given an explorer’s booklet directing taks
across the whole garden. Tasks dealt with tropical rainforest (threat by
deforestation and climate change), effects of CC on fire ecosystems, CC
and German forestry, effects of CC on alpine ecosystems and economy (ski
tourism), and renewable primary products as a means to reduce burning of
fossil fuels. Taks were coupled with a specific plant that represented
the intended content.

## 107.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: 2 psychometric instruments - 2-MEV measuring attitudes towards
preservation and utilization of nature - Inclusion of the self in nature

**Analysis**: Compare mean attitutes and INS scores across experimental
group and over three times (baseline, short-term and long-term).

**Results**: Works in the expected direction in both cases, but only
presetvation maintains its change in the “long term” (4 to 6 weeks).

**Improved?**: Results appear to change over short vs long term.

## 107.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Preservation and Utilisation of nature scales (2-MEV) and
Inclusion of Nature in the Self. (*Worked?*: Parcially, worked in the
expected direction (both short and long term) for preservation but not
so for utilization (scores returned to baseline in long-term
measurement). )

**emotions**: Inclusion of Nature in the Self (*Worked?*: Parcially,
worked in the expected direction in the short term but returned to
baselin in long-term follow-up. )

## 107.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: 1-day environmental education works well but its
effects struggles to maintain over time.

**Message to keep:**: Effective but not long-lasting intervention
overall.

**title** Concept Maps in the Classroom: A New Approach to Reveal
Students’ Conceptual Change

## 108.1 abstract

When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various
conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools
to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often
prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed
to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students’
concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude
qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the
approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions
before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For
the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied.
A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From
strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we
assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely
time-consuming handling, the authors’ approach is suitable for
application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to
inform teachers about students’ conceptions.

## 108.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Our study objective was not only (a) to reveal students’ conceptions on
climate change and to monitor conceptual change due to an environmental
education program but also (b) to provide teachers and educators with an
easily applicable approach to analyze the maps and thus, to get to know
their students’ preconceptions.

**Questions**:

Testing the 2 following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1 (H1): The frequency of
students’ alternative conceptions exhibited in concept maps may decrease
after participation in an environmental education program on climate
change. H2: Qualitative changes in conceptions exhibited in concept maps
can be revealed by simple analysis of quantitative parameters (number of
alternative concepts and number of propositions using these concepts),
thus allowing an analysis of conceptions and conceptual change in an
easily applicable way suitable for everyday school life.

## 108.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: lessons, group work, lab experiments

**Description**: A 2-day educational program on global climate change
was designed to fit in the existing curriculum for 10th- grade students,
including comprehensive ecological knowledge and environmental topics in
biology and global (climate) change in geography. It consisted of
student-centered learning units focusing on an individual learning at
workstations, group work and inquiry-based labexperiments. While the
first part of the program was conducted in the classroom, the second,
more practical part,took place in an ecological-botanical garden. Apart
from imparting knowledge about causes, mechanisms, andimpacts of climate
change, the program units were designed to provide students with ways in
which they could contribute to climate mitigation.

## 108.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Concept mapping of the students, pre-post, made by groups of
2-3 students (same groups pre-post) For students to complete their
concept map, we provided them with five concepts referring to some of
the most common alternative conceptions, as well as 20 concepts
essential to explain the scientific view of global climate change. Each
student group was provided with a blank sheet of paper and a list of the
25 predefined concepts in order to portray global climate change, its
causes, mechanisms, and impacts. Students were given 45 min to com plete
the task.

**Analysis**: Analyses were conducted (a) by counting the number of
alternative concepts included in the maps (maximum of five) and (b) the
number of propositions that used these concepts in pre- and postmaps
(quantitative analyses). Also, (c) the propositions were analyzed for
consistency with the common alternative conceptions (qualitative
analysis). For our qualitative analysis, a reference concept map
summarizes the alternative concepts described in the other studies we
reviewed previously. Based on this reference map, we decided whether a
proposition on a students’ map matched the alternative conception or
not. If matching, the proposition was scored 1, if not 0. For every map,
a sum score of alternative conceptions was formed. $$We calculated$$
interrater reliabilities (Rye & Rubba, 2002) as well as intrarater
reliabilities, which we calculated by using Cohen’s kappa (Cohen, 1960).
The scoring ranged from .76 to .87 (Table 2), which is regarded as
substantial to almost perfect (Wolf, 1997). Our first hypothesis was
tested by using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare sum scores for
(a) alternative concepts used, (b) propositions using these concepts,
and (c) alternative conceptions of pre- and postmaps. Effect sizes were
calculated applying Pearson’s correlation coefficient r. To test the
second hypothesis, we correlated the differences from pre- to postmaps
for the three parameters. Because the data set was quite small, we
decided for Kendall’s tau to calculate the correlations.

**Results**: The three parameters analyzed (use of alternative concepts,
propositions using these concepts, and student conceptions) showed
significant decreases from pre- to post-maps in the treatment group
(whereas no effects were found in the control group). $$Our qualitative
analysis$$ revealed a significant decrease in propositions that match
the common alternative conceptions \[As compared to student’s own
alternative conceptions Correlations showed alternative concepts and
propositions as strongly related to each other.

**Improved?**: The use of alternative concepts, propositions using these
concepts, and student misconceptions decreased after intervention in the
conceptual maps of the students

## 108.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Decrease of the use alternative conceptions in conceptual
maps (misconceptions) (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 108.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Compared to the control group, students of the
treatment group might have integrated the knowledge they achieved during
our educational program into their individually existing knowledge
structures: consequently, concep tual change has occurred, at least for
the time period we analyzed.

**Message to keep:**: In this study, the authors use pre-post conceptual
maps drawn by the high-school students and observe a decrease of common
misconceptions concerning climate change. They show a conceptual change
on a very short time horizon of change

**title** Climate Change Professional Development: Design,
Implementation, and Initial Outcomes on Teacher Learning, Practice, and
Student Beliefs

## 109.1 abstract

In this work, we present the design, implementation, and initial
outcomes of the Climate Academy, a hybrid professional development
program delivered through a combination of face-to-face and online
interactions, intended to prepare formal and informal science teachers
(grades 5–16) in teaching about climate change. The Climate Academy was
designed around core elements of successful environmental professional
development programs and aligned with practices advocated in benchmarked
science standards. Data were collected from multiple sources including
observations of professional development events, participants’
reflections on their learning, and collection of instructional units
designed during the Academy. Data were also collected from a focal case
study teacher in a middle school setting. Case study data included
classroom observations, teacher interviews, and student beliefs toward
climate change. Results indicated that the Climate Academy fostered
increased learning among participants of both climate science content
and pedagogical strategies for teaching about climate change.
Additionally, results indicated that participants applied their new
learning in the design of climate change instructional units. Finally,
results from the case study indicated positive impacts on student
beliefs and greater awareness about climate change. Results have
implications for the design of professional development programs on
climate change, a topic included for the first time in national
standards. © 2016, The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.

## 109.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This hybrid professional development program intended to prepare formal
and informal science teachers (grades 5–16) in teaching about climate
change.

**Questions**:

How can we support the design of PD programs grounded in the NGSS that
promote changes in teacher learning, instructional practice, and student
beliefs around climate change?

## 109.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Educational activities

**Description**: A number of activities were conducted in the outdoor
setting of the Climate Academy, which was surrounded by coastal wetlands
ideal for conducting inquiry-based work on climate and demonstrating the
effects of climate on one’s local context and earth’s spheres. Finally,
to establish connections between new learning and practice, all teachers
designed instructional units (3–5 h of instructional time) that
integrated climate science in their curricula, reflected on their
designs and shared ideas with peers.

## 109.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: For the current data analysis, student pre- and post-responses
were exported into excel and the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS). Student profiles were calculated for both the pre- and
post-administration of the survey.

**Analysis**: NA

**Results**: Results indicated that the Climate Academy fostered
increased learning among participants of both climate science content
and pedagogical strategies for teaching about climate change.
Additionally, results indicated that participants applied their new
learning in the design of climate change instructional units.

**Improved?**: results from the case study indicated positive impacts on
student beliefs and greater awareness about climate change. Results have
implications for the design of professional development programs on
climate change, a topic included for the first time in national
standards.

## 109.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: yes (*Worked?*: yes )

## 109.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: results from the case study indicated positive impacts
on student beliefs and greater awareness about climate change. Results
have implications for the design of professional development programs on
climate change, a topic included for the first time in national
standards.

**Message to keep:**: implementation of climate change instructional
units that focus on both content knowledge and practices advocated in
the new standards (e.g., rich open-ended tasks, evidence, and data
supporting conclusions around climate change) can begin to initiate a
shift in student beliefs.

**title** Experiential climate change education: Challenges of
conducting mixed-methods, interdisciplinary research in San Juan
Islands, WA and Oakland,CA

## 110.1 abstract

Transitioning food, energy and water systems for adaptation and
mitigation of climate change is a challenge requiring social as well as
technological solutions. The best technological solutions will only be
effective if combined with behavior changes placing climate change at
the forefront of our socio-cultural consciousness. Education is central
in creating such a shift. Climate researchers have an important role in
aiding the uptake of climate change education in U.S. public schools,
where educators are often untrained and uncomfortable teaching the
subject. This paper assesses the efficacy of implementing an
interdisciplinary, experiential climate change curriculum in school
garden classrooms in terms of student climate literacy and teacher
professional development. The questions of how to teach and research
climate education are explored via a participatory research project with
schools in Oakland, CA and Lopez Island, WA. Initial results show
improvement in student learning and engagement as well as teacher
preparation. Both qualitative and quantitative data are analyzed through
student surveys, teacher interviews, and site observation; however,
further qualitative methodologies to study process of climate and energy
literacy development are needed. Specifically, this paper argues for new
forms of assessment to capture dimensions of climate literacy including
knowledge, engagement, and behavior change.

## 110.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

For students: ” students learn climate change from a content expert” For
teachers: “teachers increase knowledge and competence in climate change
instruction, allowing future students benefit from a better-trained
instructor and serving as a form of professional development.”

**Questions**:

“assesses the efficacy of implementing an interdisciplinary,
experiential climate change curriculum in school garden classrooms in
terms of student climate literacy and teacher professional development.”

## 110.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: six in-class lessons, specific content or methods is not
clearly explained.

**Description**: Although it is precised that it deals with local issues
of food production, water conservation and understanding clean energy
systems. It also involves guest speakers trying to connect studentss
with “change-makers” outside the school setting. Intervention presents
CC as not “just” a science problem but as a societal problem that
requires engaging “minds” (by learning scientific facts), “hearts”( by
situating CC in the broader social and personal contexts and history)
and “hands” (by fostering hands-on solutions and activities).
Co-teaching with content experts was also implemented. A supplemental
materials word doc whosw lesson content: - Lesson 1: What is climate
change, what is evidence? What are indicators? Uses a direct instruction
and outdoor learning methods. - Lesson 2: Causes of global temperature
rise, role of agriculture. Uses a direct instruction and outdoor
learning methods. - Lesson 3: Repercussions of climate change and what
this means for global/local food production. Uses Socratic and outdoor
learning. - Lesson 4: How to monitor repercussions in food system? Uses
interactive, outdoor methods. - Lesson 5: How to minimize repercussions…
SOLUTIONS. Uses active and collaborative methods. - Lesson 6: Student
projects for monitoring and minimizing climate change through school
garden. Uses active/ participatory methods.

## 110.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Survey on CC knowledge and attitues for students. In-depth
interviews for teachers. Observations in both cases.

**Analysis**: Quantitative for students knowledge about CC and attitudes
towards it. Qualitative for teachers.

**Results**: Intervention works in both samples.

**Improved?**: All of them. Although most of the qualitative results on
teachers were centered on pedagogy (e.g. whether they felt co-teaching
helped, whether they felt more empowered to teach about CC rather than
directly content on CC).

## 110.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Students viewed CC as a more social problem (i.e. linked
to forms of production, who CC impacts…), rather than a “simply” simply
scientific one. (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Students were more aware of the effects of CC in their
local environment. (*Worked?*: yes )

**intention**: Students selected a larger number of environmental
activites in the pre- compared to the post-intervention. (*Worked?*: yes
)

**other**: Teachers self-efficacy to teach CC. Students attitudes
towards CC (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 110.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Intervention works in both samples although further
information is neede to assess student’s actual engagement in behaviour
and understanding of complex web of causes surrounding CC.

**Message to keep:**: Effective in knowledge although more centered in
pedagogical variables than in CC.

Abstract The results of the application of a pedagogical proposal, based
on the guiding principles of liberating pedagogy, are presented, through
the offer of a semester course (“Yes, in Ceará there is this!”) with
content on earthquakes and climate change for students from a full-time
public school located in an area of social vulnerability (HDI 0.395) in
Fortaleza, Ceará. The results showed that the adoption of this
pedagogical practice provides, in addition to the dissemination of
theoretical and scientific knowledge, awareness to develop future
actions aimed at mitigating the risks and effects of natural disasters
triggered by possible changes in the climate and by the occurrence of
earthquakes in the communities. Thus, the cooperative teaching-learning
process provided the appropriation of knowledge about earthquakes and
climate change, being able to provoke among the participating students
actions and ideas aimed at sensitizing the community about the effects
of anthropogenic climate changes, enabling the training people aware of
their role in the community in which they live.

## 111.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “The students realize that they are exposed to dangers
(disasters) related to climate change and seismic activity in the
region. In addition, it is possible to identify in these students a
concern, in the form of environmental awareness, about what needs to be
done to live with this reality in a preventive and active way, knowing
how to behave correctly in the event of disasters, natural or
otherwise.”

**Message to keep:**: The authors present the results of a post
evaluation of a semester course implemented in a public school in
Brazil. The course is focused on increasing knowledge about seismic
activity in the Ceará region and the authors mention that climate change
increases the chances of natural disasters occurring. The course is not
described, so there is no way of knowing what they do during the
semester that the course lasts. The results show that students end up
with high levels of knowledge about seismic activity in the Ceará area
(Brazil), as well as about preventive actions to mitigate damage in
earthquakes. Ninety-four percent of the students reported believing that
climate change is due to human actions and 97% indicated that if global
warming continues to increase there could be an increase in the
occurrence of natural disasters. Finally, students showed high levels of
knowledge about consumption habits that could reduce human impact on
climate change (e.g., reducing the use of fossil fuels, stopping
deforestation, planting more trees, etc.). The only indicator that falls
below 85% is the reduction of cattle consumption (only 67% see it as a
habit that could reduce human-caused climate change).

**title** Playing for Change: Teens’ Attitudes Towards Climate Change
Action as Expressed Through Interactive Digital Narrative Play

## 112.1 abstract

We designed and pilot tested “You and CO2”, a program designed to
encourage students to reflect on their personal impact on the
environment, while also appreciating their place within society to bring
about positive societal change. Over three interlinked workshops,
students analysed the carbon footprints of some everyday activities,
which they then explored in more detail through interacting with a
bespoke piece of interactive digital narrative (IDN), No World 4
Tomorrow. Previous papers have discussed the feasibility of the program
and student engagement with the concepts. This paper presents analysis
of the playthrough data as each participant in the program played the
IDN to completion, examining trends in story selection choices for how
they reflect students’ understandings and attitudes towards climate
change and their own ability to make a difference in matters large and
small pertaining to climate change.

## 112.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To pilot test “You and CO2”, a program designed to encourage students to
reﬂect on their personal impact on the environment

**Questions**:

What are the trends in story selection choices for how they reﬂect
students’ understandings and attitudes towards climate change and their
own ability to make a difference in matters large and small pertaining
to climate change

## 112.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: The YCO2 program consists of three workshops of 1to 2 hours
each conducted by researchers. Depending on the school, class, and
instructor needs. Likewise, according to needs and schedules,
instructors may conduct the workshops on subsequent days, or spread them
out over the course of several weeks or months.

**Description**: Intervention (fully described in a different paper)
includes lesson plans, activity worksheets, discussion questions and
prompts, and rubrics, as well as the program IDN No World 4 Tomorrow and
tutorials for the students to create their own IDNs. This paper focuses
on IDN program. 4 schools had different treatments around the IDN
program: School 1: 3 x 1 hour sessions, separated by a month between
each. School 2: three workshops were taught on successive days as part
of a special STEM week. School 3: workshops 1 and 2 were tought in dec
2020 the 3rd during pandemic in hybrid mode. School 4: students visited
Swansea university as part of an eco-day and conducted a ceach litter
pick activity and an energy-saving tour and then workshop 2.

## 112.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: NA

**Analysis**: Researchers collected playthrough data every time a
student played the project IDN, recording the links they clicked
throughout the interactive story. Proportional analysis was manually
conducted of the data from a grounded theory perspective, qualitatively
reviewing the data to reveal patterns for further analysis. Prior to
Workshop 1, students completed a survey measuring their knowledge of and
attitudes regarding climate change. In addition to this (not reported on
this paper) they surveyed the students regarding knowledge of and
attitudes about climate change before and after the program intervention
and collected the work of the students for qualitative analysis yielding

**Results**: NA

**Improved?**: students choices indicate positive attitudes towards
climate change action, in line with the initial survey data we have
analysed (Rudd et al., 2019; Horry et al. in review). It is likely,
however, that these young people struggle with the notion of taking
action as individuals, particularly when it comes to encouraging both
their peers and their elders to do so as well.

**title** Teaching climate change science to high school students using
computer games in an intermedia narrative

## 113.1 abstract

We explored how computer games developed as part of an innovative set of
climate change education materials helped students learn and gain
interest in global climate change (GCC) science by making it personally
relevant and understandable. This research was conducted in a public
school district in the southeastern United States. The curriculum,
Climate Change Narrative Game Education (CHANGE), used a local,
place-based approach using scientific data gathered from the Gulf of
Mexico coast and incorporated (a) computer games, (b) a scientifically
web-based science fiction novel about future Gulf coast residents, and
(c) hands-on laboratory activities. This paper focuses on how the
computer games affected students’ learning, validity of their beliefs
about GCC, and understanding of the effects of GCC on the region’s sea
level and storms. The data collected included students’ exam scores, and
surveys about student perceptions of climate change science and
perceptions of the materials. On exam questions related to GCC science,
students who participated in the CHANGE curriculum scored significantly
higher than their peers who did not. Also, their beliefs about GCC
increased in validity. The nature and design of the computer games had a
strong impact on students’ understanding of sea level rise and storms. ©

students with moderate or minimal usage of CHANGE materials did not
score significantly higher than no usage”

However, in the Results: $$honor students$$ “Post hoc comparisons using
the (Least significant Difference) LSD test indicated that the mean
scores for the most usage condition (M = 53.0, SD = 17.02), moderate
usage condition (M = 51.7, SD = 17.66), and less usage condition (M =
52.8, SD = 19.18) were significantly higher than for the no usage
condition (M = 46.31, SD = 16.56). Partial eta squared was .025, for a
medium effect size. However, there were no statistically significant
differences between the three groups (the most, moderate, and less usage
conditions)” $$non-honor students$$ “Post hoc comparisons using the LSD
test indicated that the mean scores for the moderate usage condition (M
= 51.6, SD = 20.67) and less usage condition (M = 43.3, SD = 15.99) were

**title** Using inquiry-based dialogues to explore controversial climate
change issues with secondary students: An example from Norway

## 114.1 abstract

Young people around the world show considerable engagement with climate
change. How can education draw on this engagement in order to benefit
students and society? In this article, we discuss how inquiry-based
dialogues can support students’ development in their societal
engagement. We argue that such dialogues should include real-world
problems involving disagreement, which promote students’ agency. We
elaborate on qualities of dialogues, such as developing argumentation
and perspectives together through respect, attentive listening and
recognition of others’ viewpoints. Central theoretical perspectives
include inquiry-based dialogues and students’ lived democracy. This
research draws on data from a classroom activity where 15-16-year-old
students in Norway investigate controversial issues related to
electrifying offshore oil platforms. The students are in a learning
situation, and the teacher wants them to learn about climate change and
the oil industry and the skills and attitudes needed to participate in
inquiry-based dialogues. The dialogues show that students bring
knowledge, opinions and attitudes from outside school, characteristics
that are crucial for students’ engagement. We discuss how teachers can
facilitate students’ further engagement by addressing multiple aims of
inquiry-based dialogues.

## 114.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To evaluate how teachers can facilitate students’ further engagement by
addressing multiple aims of inquiry-based dialogues.

**Questions**:

After the invertention, the students will be able to: • Reason about
global and local climate challenges related to fossil fuels and explain
different views on this. • See the connection between Norway’s oil
production and the country as a welfare state. • Discuss Norway’s role
as an oil and gas producing country

## 114.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Educational activities

**Description**: A class from a teacher was recorded and the teacher
designed a dialogue game containing claims to be discussed in groups of
3–4 students. Teacher asks them to read a claim out loud, then place a
board piece on one of the areas on the board saying ‘agree’, ‘partly
agree’, or ‘disagree’, and then present a reason for their choice.

## 114.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Recording the dialogues during the class and then described
the results.

**Analysis**: participants were given a pre-test and a post-test. a
paired t test on the difference between the pre-test and post-test
results of each participant

**Results**: The dialogues show that students bring knowledge, opinions
and attitudes from outside school, characteristics that are crucial for
students’ engagement.

**Improved?**: understanding and knowledge improved

## 114.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: increased knowledge (*Worked?*: no )

## 114.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Dialogical listening is essential in inquiry-based
dialogues, and students must learn to develop competencies as dialogical
listeners. The students’ dialogues could have been more investigative,
paying more attention to each other and exposing more
counter-argumentation.

**Message to keep:**: Further research should focus on how teachers can
give space to explore contemporary societal issues, requiring a range of
approaches. Dialogical listening and equal opportunities for all
students should be emphasised. Young people’s voices matter, and
inquiry-based dialogues can strengthen their agency and empowerment

**title** Climate change and costs: investigating students’ reasoning on
nature and economic development

## 115.1 abstract

The tensions between environmental protection and economic growth are
critical to future well-being, and it is therefore important to
understand how young people conceptualize these tensions. The aim of the
present study is to explore students’ solutions to the dilemma of
economic development and mitigating climate change, with regard to
societal responses to the challenge of climate change. The study was
conducted in China’s Green Schools. Green School is an international
long-term programme with the aim of increasing students’ knowledge of
environmental issues, and transferring this knowledge into positive
actions to affect the wider community. The data were obtained through
semi-structured pre- and post-interviews with 15-16-year-old students in
three groups (12 students) from Green Schools in the Beijing area. The
results show that students’ discussions focused exclusively on economic
growth and social welfare. Students seem to believe that environmental
problems are inevitable, nature is a ‘box’ of resources, and economic
development is necessary in order to sustain and even improve nature.
Therefore, there is no dilemma between economic development and
environmental protection. The paper ends with a discussion on research
and implications for teaching climate change.

## 115.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

“the aim of increasing students’ knowledge of environmental issues, and
transferring this knowledge into positive actions to affect the wider
community.”

**Questions**:

“In the pre-interviews, the interview questions were: (1) Do you think a
car factory should be set up or not? Why? (2) Does a car factory have
any impact on climate change? The interviews were conducted in a
secluded room at the students’ respective schools and lasted about 30
minutes. The post interviews were conducted immediately after the
debate. The main questions were: Should a car factory be built or not?
Why? This interview lasted 15–30 minutes.”

## 115.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Role play.

**Description**: Groups of grous students were instructed to role play a
pannel of judges deciding whether to install a car factory in an
economically depressed village. The factory will increase cO2 emission
due to the manufacturing process and the emissions of cars themselves
but will hellp out village and country’s economic growth. Different
groups were instructed to roleplay ecologists (emphasizing environmental
protection)m government officials (emphasizing social and economic
benefits), UN representatives (emphasizing global CC) or village’s
representatives (emphasizing outcome and welfare). Sample students
listened to the debate and were instructed to reach a conclusion fairly
and objectively. Pre-post evaluation deals with students decisions and
reasoning behind allowing or not allowing for the car factory to be
built.

## 115.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: in-depth interviews

**Analysis**: Code of utterances in pre-post interviews in 3 main
aspects: economic develoment, natureand societal focus.

**Results**: Both outcomes improved

**Improved?**: Both social impact of CC and decision (allowing for the
construction of the car factory) outcomes improved after the
intervention.

## 115.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Yes, students reasoned more on a societal sense and
taking into account negative consequences of CC on society rather than
simply the economic benefits in the post-intervention compared to pre.
(*Worked?*: yes )

**action**: Yes, students decided NOT to build the factory in the
post-intervention compared to the pre. (*Worked?*: yes )

## 115.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Role playing as judges in a debate on the convenience
of setting up an polluting factory seems to improve green behaviour and
foster a societal view of economical issues rather than simply an
economic mindset.

**Message to keep:**: Role playing games on a realistic decision with
both negative climate impact and positive economic impact allows to more
easily understand both climate and social causes and impacts of CC.

**title** Developing a model of climate change behavior among
adolescents

## 116.1 abstract

Research on adolescent climate change perceptions has uncovered key
insights about how knowledge, concern, and hope might relate to behavior
and the potential for educational interventions to influence these
factors. However, few of these studies have employed treatment/control
designs that might address causality and none have addressed how these
factors might interact to influence behavior. We developed a model of
behavior change where a climate education treatment impacted knowledge,
knowledge impacted hope and concern, and hope and concern together
impacted behavior. We empirically tested the utility of this model and
the causal relationships within it using a pre/post, treatment/control
evaluation of climate education among adolescents in North Carolina, USA
(n=1041). We found support for a causal relationship between the
treatment and gains in knowledge, but not between treatment and
behavior. However, we did find support for a path model in which climate
change knowledge positively relates to increased climate change concern
and hope, and increases in concern and hope predict changes in
pro-environmental behavior. Low SES was related to smaller gains in
knowledge, concern, and behavior. Our results contribute to a
theoretical understanding of climate change behaviors among adolescents
and suggest that climate education aiming to change behavior should
focus on building hope and concern.

## 116.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To test a model that incorporates insights about how knowledge, concern,
and hope might relate to behavior and the potential for educational
interventions to influence these factors.

**Questions**:

Authors hypothesized that: The intervention would directly and
positively impact climate change science knowledge Increased climate
change knowledge would lead to increased climate change concern and hope
Changes in concern and hope would be positively related to changes in
climate change behavior

## 116.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Activities incorporated in the curriculum

**Description**: The educational intervention included four activities
modeled after Project WILD focusing on wildlife biology, ecology, and
conservation (see projectwild.org) characterized by highly engaging,
hands-on activities. Activities focused on (1) the difference between
weather and climate, (2) how climate and weather relate to location of
habitats and wildlife, (3) how wildlife managers can and are planning
for climate change, and (4) how individual actions can mitigate climate
change and improve climate resilience among wildlife

## 116.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: NA

**Analysis**: Statistical analysis to test a hipothesized Path model
that allows to test direct and indirect relations

**Results**: Increased knowledge predicted increased hope and concern,
which together predicted increased levels of climate change mitigation
behaviors More specifically,change in knowledge appeared more strongly
associated with change in concern (β= 0.088) than change in hope
(β=0.077) (Fig. 2, Fig. S1). Change in hope (β= 0.110) appeared to be a
slightly stronger predictor of change in behavior than change in concern
(β= 0.105) (Fig. 2, Fig. S2). Students attending Title I schools (lower
SES) were less likely to display increased knowledge, concern, and
behavior with all other variables held constant (Fig. 2, Figs. S1, S2).

**Improved?**: They found partial support for a causal relationship
between the treatment and gains in knowledge, but not between treatment
and behavior. But they found support for a path model whereby knowledge
positively relates to increased climate change concern and hope, and
increases in concern and hope predict changes in pro-environmental
behavior

## 116.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: knowledge (climate change science, causes, and impacts
(*Worked?*: yes )

**awareness**: concern (e.g., communicating the impacts of climate
change on wildlife), (*Worked?*: yes )

**emotions**: hope (e.g., what others are doing, what you can do)
(*Worked?*: yes )

**action**: pro-environmental behavior (*Worked?*: Partially )

**other**: Authors are testing a model of direct and indirect relations
(*Worked?*: They found partial support for a causal relationship between
the treatment and gains in knowledge, but not between treatment and
behavior. But they found support for a path model whereby knowledge
positively relates to increased climate change concern and hope, and
increases in concern and hope predict changes in pro-environmental
behavior )

## 116.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: This study provides empirical evidence of a
relationship between knoledge, hope and concern, and behavior, and in
particular that hope rather than concern predicts proenvironmental
behavior. It also provides evidence of the diferent effects of
interventions depending on socioeconomic status of students

**title** Framing climate change communication to prompt individual and
collective action among adolescents from agricultural communities

## 117.1 abstract

Climate communication research suggests strategic message framing may
help build public consensus on climate change causes, risks and
solutions. However, few have investigated how framing applies to
adolescents. Similarly, little research has focused on agricultural
audiences, who are among the most vulnerable to and least accepting of
climate change. Among 950 high school agriculture students in North
Carolina, we found agriculture and environment framing of climate
change, but not community and health frames, elicited feelings of worry,
and these together with community frames elicited hope. Further,
students feeling more worry were more supportive of individual and
collective action. Those accepting climate change and females had more
emotive responses and higher support for all action measures, and
acceptance of human causes predicted more worry and support for
collective action. We find these results encouraging as agriculture
teachers likely employ agriculture and environment frames when following
best teaching practices.

## 117.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study begins to address the need to examine how message framing may
affect emotional responses to climate change and subsequent individual
and collective action among adolescents with a case study of
agricultural students in North Carolina.

**Questions**:

NA

## 117.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: $$The intervention is just the presentation to
students of an article with different framings (agriculture, health
etc), it is done in a school, but I am not sure the
Curricular/Extracurricular makes sense in this case. If anything I would
tend to extracurricular because it is not in the regular activity
programme of the students$$

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Reading one article

**Description**: students were randomly presented with a climate news
story presented in one of four frames: agriculture, community, health,
and environment

## 117.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: One questionnaire: - we asked respondents about the degree to
which they agreed that climate change is (1) happening and (2) human
caused - students were asked to respond to the degree to which the
article $$randomly assigned framing (agriculture, community, health, and
environment)$$ made them feel worried or hopeful. - students were asked
to respond to questions about support for adaptation and mitigation
measures - We measured intentions to participate in individual actions
with items addressing information seeking, individual energy saving
behaviours, and transportation choices

**Analysis**: ANOVA for testing for differences in emotional responses
(i.e. hope and worry) associated with the different frames. Posthoc
Tukey test - Path model analysis to test for a model including effect of
the framing on worry and hope and then predicted support for adaptation,
support for mitigation, intended individual behavior. Variables
controlled for: gender, belief that global warming is happening, belief
that it is human caused, and political affiliation (Republican,
Democrat, Unaffiliated or Independent)

**Results**: on average, students felt intermediate levels of hope (2.42
out of 5, SD = 1.08) and worry (mean = 2.63/5, SD = 1.27) - Framing was
related to changes in hopefulness (df = 3, F = 6.2, p \< 0.001), but not
changes in worry (df = 3, F = 2.35, p = 0.071) or either measure of
collective action (adaptation: df = 3, F = 0.50, p = 0.681; mitigation:
df = 3, F = 0.70, p = 0.555) Path analysis: - We identified a mediating
relationship where agricultural or environmental framing predicted the
emotion of worry, which in turn predicted intended individual behaviour
and support for collective action - We found no difference in
hopefulness between those students who read the environment or community
frames compared with those who read the agriculture frames - We also
found partial support for our hypothesis that students who felt more
worry and hope after reading the climate change news article would be
more likely to report intended individual behaviour and support for
collective action Uncontrolled variable: - Females were more worried and
hopeful than males, as well as more likely to support adaptation and
mitigation measures and report intended individual climate-friendly
actions - the more likely students were to report that they thought
global warming was happening, the more likely they were to report
feelings of worry and hope, as well as support for adaptation, mit
igation, and individual climate-friendly behaviours - Republicans were
less likely than Independents or those politically unaffiliated students
to support mitigation actions. - We found that those accepting of human
causes had similar responses to framing as reflected in the overall
summary statistics, with environment and community frames associated
with a more hopeful response than health frames (Figure 3). However,
among those sceptical of human causes, the agriculture frame was
associated with greater levels of hopefulness than environment and
health frames (Figure 3).

**Improved?**: Framing was related to change in hopefulness but not in
changes in worry. These analyses can’t really be analysed in terms of
“improved or not”.

## 117.6 Outcomes

**intention**: - support for adaptation and mitigation measures -
intentions to participate in individual actions with items addressing
information seeking, individual energy saving behaviours, and
transportation choices (*Worked?*: NA )

**emotions**: degree to which the article made the students feel worried
or hopeful (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 117.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Agricultural students seem to respond most strongly to
environment and agricultural frames, however the results are somewhat
constrained by external variables such as gender and political views.

**Message to keep:**: The intervention in this paper is very simple:
agriculture students read a paper on Climate change with various
framings (agriculture, community, health, and environment). When the
framing is about agriculture/environment, it has a greater effect on
students emotions (hopefulness). However this is mediated by other
factors such as gender and political views (belief around anthropogenic
climate change). Extra result which might be worth noting: -
understanding human causes of climate change had no relationship with
individual behaviour (encouraging according to authors)

**title** What Creative Ideas Came Up about Global Warming in RADEC
Online Class?

## 118.1 abstract

The study aims to investigate the effects of an online learning model,
Read-Answer-Discuss-Explain-Create (RADEC), on the emergence of creative
ideas and projects for 7th-grade students when designing local solutions
to global warming problems. Case studies were used in this research by
implementing learning in environmental science concepts. This one-shot
case study research was conducted on 30 7th-grade students (16 boys and
14 girls) selected through the purposive sampling technique. The
research was conducted in Bandung, Indonesia. Five stages are carried
out in the RADEC learning model, including the Read-Answer stage, where
students answered pre-learning questions outside the classroom; the
Discuss-Explain stage, where students responded to their pre-learning
questions in small and large groups; and the Create stage, where
students agreed on solutions to a problem and realised the product of a
creative project. Qualitative data were collected through worksheets,
posters, and guided interviews. Although students have not been able to
demonstrate originality thinking skills, the implementation of the
online RADEC model stimulated students’ fluency and flexibility thinking
skills. This was evident from the many creative ideas or projects of
students. Besides, students could decide on ideas or group projects to
solve global warming problems with rational considerations. Although the
online RADEC model has not been able to produce original creative
products, its implementation has stimulated students to think creatively
about solving global warming problems. In addition, the implications,
limitations, advantages and potential of further research are discussed
in this paper. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2022.

## 118.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

the purpose of this case study was to collect and describe students’
creative ideas or projects related to handling environmental pollution
problems when the RADEC model was delivered online.

**Questions**:

1.  What are students’ initial ideas or projects in the RADEC learning
    model?
2.  What are the chosen ideas or projects for each group in the RADEC
    learning model?

## 118.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: NA

**Indoor/Outdoor**: NA

**Type**: NA

**Description**: The RADEC is a learning model that integrates science
content knowledge, engineering design, and creativity to help students
understand the fundamental concepts of science in the science and other
components of the required curriculum of Indonesia. It involves: 1. Read
stage: reinforces the originality aspect by directing students to think
about unique solutions that have not been thought of by others 2. Answer
and Explain stages: intentionally engage students in solving problems
through multiple ways and then present those solutions in public 3.
Discuss stage: allows students opportunities in groups to interpret
pictures, stories, or problems 4. Evaluation aspect: includes designing
a work plan of triggered ideas, and with the originality aspect in
choosing another more distinctive method 5. Create stage: is compatible
with the elaboration aspect in developing and enriching ideas

## 118.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: 1. Pre-learning questionnaires were used to determine
students’ understanding of fundamental science concepts and possible
solutions for solving local environmental pollution problems. The
pre-learning questions were arranged and made based on the indicators of
concept mastery and creative thinking skills. They also had a content
judgement from experts. At the end of the pre-learning questions,
students an open question on how to solve global warming. They
communicated their ideas freely. 2. Worksheets were used to collect
ideas or creative projects throughout the study, as well as tools,
materials, and working procedures. Guided interviews, were used to
confirm information that was unclear from student worksheets.

**Analysis**: The data obtained from this study is a description of the
creative ideas generated by students. Therefore, the triangulation
technique is suitable for use. Triangulation alludes to using different
strategies or information sources in a subjective personal investigation
to create a comprehensive understanding of marvels.

**Results**: NA

**Improved?**: Students ideas for projects which was part of the post
measure, increased in number and diversity (although not in originality)
in comparison to those reported in the pre-intervention questionnaire

## 118.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Creative ideas addressing local environmental pollution.

**title** Changing attitude into behavior: How to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions

## 119.1 abstract

This article’s focus was on transitioning middle grade students from the
position of having a positive environmental attitude toward their
exhibiting actual behaviors that address climate change. Using research
by Newhouse’s criteria of changing attitude into behavior, specific
activities were developed and tested in a eighth grade classroom. The 5E
model of instruction was the strategy used to build the series of
activities. Thus, we began the class with a series of engaging questions
for discussion to differentiate between attitudes and behaviors.
Building a knowledge base about the negative outcomes of climate change
as well as new technologies that exist to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions were the initial explorations and strategies used to move
students from attitude to behavior. The groups’ development and
implementation of classroom presentations where they learn about
negative climate change outcomes and the technologies available to
address these outcomes were described. Discerning what was accurate
Internet information and post presentation discussions were some of the
review strategies used for explanation to occur. The two foundation
building presentation activities were followed by two behavior-based
activities (i.e., extension/elaboration) for the purpose of moving
students from positive attitudes to positive behaviors with regard to
addressing climate change.

**title** Weather, Climate, Web 2.0: 21st Century Students Speak Climate
Science Well

## 120.1 abstract

Problem-based learning (PBL) and inquiry learning (IL) employ extensive
scaffolding that results in cognitive load reduction and allows students
to learn in complex domains. Hybrid teacher professional development
models (PDM) using 21st century social collaboration tools embedding PBL
and IL shows promise as a systemic approach for increasing teacher
content knowledge of climate science and ubiquitous social media
technology skills. This paper describes workshops designed to increase
the climate pedagogical content knowledge (CPCK) of upper elementary and
secondary teachers while providing initial and on-going scaffolding for
successful implementation of PBL projects involving collaborative
research on local, regional and global climate topics. Exemplars of
participation by the K-12 students in the citizen scientist component of
the “From Learning to Research” project (L2R) are described, including
illustrations of recognition by local and global community members
regarding students’ contributions to reducing anthropomorphic impact on
local ecosystems.

**title** Shapes of water—A multidisciplinary composing project
visioning an eco-socially oriented approach to music education

## 121.1 abstract

This article presents a project, Shapes of Water, funded by the Finnish
Cultural Foundation, which gave music education students the opportunity
to compose children’s songs about climate change with the help of
artists from two fields (contemporary circus and music) and a scientist
(chemistry). The article outlines the ways in which the composing
project challenged students’ attitudes toward composing as a method for
educating children about climate change, and brings together the
experiences of the artists and scientist during the project. Finally,
three focus areas are presented with recommendations for a sustainable
eco-socially oriented approach to music education.

**Type**: Composing project

**Description**: The starting point for the composing project was Shapes
of Water, a contemporary circus work that took place in early 2022. The
work talked about the changing states of water in northern surroundings
through circus, contemporary dance, light and video photography, and
projection. Shapes of Water described the relationship between human and
water states through two dancing and mutually supportive bodies,
stories, and images. The work was created by the circus and dance artist
couple Katariina and Jared Van Earle, Kat&Jared. After their performance
at the beginning of this composing project, Kat&Jared held a workshop
for both groups (major and minor) to inspire students to discuss the
feelings and ideas their performance evoked. Collaboration with
Kat&Jared and Soiva Siili enabled ways to expand the effectiveness of
contemporary circus work and share the artistic processes of
professional artists with music education students. Students, in turn,
composed children’s songs about climate change in workshops (40 hr for
major students, 20 hr for minor students). The workshops included, for
example: (a) introduction to and execution of the group composing method
of Soiva Siili, (b) development of awareness in taking inspiration from
other art forms and the environment, and (c) independent composing work
in small groups (four to six students). After 3 months’ work, the
results of the composing project were performed in two concerts at the
University of Oulu. The concerts were named after one new song: “Holding
on to Tomorrow With Both Hands.” The original idea was to target the
concerts to 11- to 12-year-old 6 children, but other age groups and
other university students and staff were also invited. The concerts
lasted for 1 hr and included 10 songs relating to climate change (five
by major students, five by minor students). Kat&Jared choreographed
three songs and also performed in the concerts. Accordingly, Soiva Siili
and Professor Pursiainen had their own roles in the concerts. Most of
the songs2 and their sheet music were sent to the schools that
participated in the concerts so that the teachers could use the songs in
their teaching. In addition, the students had an opportunity to record
their songs in a studio if they wanted.

## 121.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Questionnaire

**Analysis**: Thematic content analysis

**Results**: Art as a game changer was notable. All the students were
aware of climate change, but the composing project strengthened their
understanding about the power of music in making a difference in daily
educational practices. Composing itself was seen as a good way to
educate children for a more sustainable way of living. The students also
reflected on the impact of climate change on their own pedagogical
thinking. They realized that their role as future music educators is to
educate their pupils to act toward a better future in and through music.
They also realized how their own musical activities through composing
can serve as a pedagogical tool in tackling difficult and sometimes very
emotional and even frightening themes. In many answers, awareness of
climate change seemed to turn students’ gaze to the future and to the
solutions that could promote a more sustainable lifestyle in school.

**Improved?**: Rise awareness of climate change throw the composing
project.

## 121.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: Rise awareness of climate change using music as a way of
expression and disemination. (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 121.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: the composing project helped participating students to
understand that instead of simply pointing out the problems of the
current situations (or even dystopic views of the future), new
perspectives and bold solutions in music education are needed, and, most
importantly, they are possible.

**Message to keep:**: This article focuses on the advantages of using
music as a way to rise awareness of climate change, specifically, when
it refers to give to music teachers tools to create activities in
different educational contexts that could adress thoughts and feelings
related to climate change.

**title** A Design-based Approach to Fostering Understanding of Global
Climate Change

## 122.1 abstract

To prepare students to make informed decisions and gain coherent
understanding about global climate change, we tested and refined a
middle school inquiry unit that featured interactive visualizations.
Based on evidence from student pre-test responses, we increased emphasis
on energy transfer and transformation. The first iteration improved
comprehension of the visualizations resulting in better understanding of
energy transfer (n = 67). The second iteration improved understanding of
energy transformation (n = 109) by adding pivotal cases, reducing
deceptive clarity, and emphasizing distinguishing of ideas. Focusing
student investigations in the second version allowed students to make
more normative, personally relevant decisions related to their energy
use. These iterative refinements reflected knowledge integration
principles and offer guidance for designers of inquiry units. © 2012

## 122.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

NA

**Questions**:

. make the content accessible (e.g., build on student ideas, connect to
personally rel- evant experiences, focus attention on salient
information); . help students learn from each other (e.g. encourage
students to compare view- points, involve students in debate, support
negotiation of meaning); . make thinking visible (e.g., link multiple
representations, model scientific thinking, visually represent data
collected by students); and . promote autonomous lifelong learning
(e.g., establish a generalized inquiry process using the inquiry map
(Figure 1), include predictions and explanations, encourage reflection
on alternatives, support problem finding)

## 122.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons and cooperative work in pairs of students

**Description**: Web inquiry-based intervention in which pairs of
students took turns resolving a number of task that required them to
test theories on the mechanisms and consequences of CC. Activities deal
with Radiation and Energy transformation, Radiation reflection, Earth’s
Athmosphere, Natural greenhouse effect and the Human contribution to it.

## 122.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Mainly quantitative (surveys and integrated knowledge scores
taken from the MySystem and Energy Story assessments) complemented by
in-depth interviews of students and professors.

**Analysis**: pre-post quantitative comparisons and coding of interviews
with professor’s and students.

**Results**: All assessments (multiple choice questions, Energy Story
and MySystem assessments) showed significant and small to medium effect
sizes differences between pre- and post-intervention phases.

**Improved?**: Complexity and coherence of CC knowledge significantly
improved in the post-intervention phase compared to pre-intervention.

## 122.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Several ways to assess integrated knowledge of CC filed
out in dyads. -multiple choice and explanation questions about
greenhouse effect and its consequences. - Energy Story: a narrative
reflecting student’s understanding of energy creation, transformation
and use. - MySystem: a computer interface allowing creation of diagrams
reflecting how energy enters and exits and object and how it is
consumed. All knowledge assessments were used identically in the pre-
and post-intervention stages. All assessments aimed at Knowledge
Integration, meaning that knowledge about CC is not only known but also
allows students to better understand the wider impacts and causes of CC
and its consequences. (*Worked?*: yes )

## 122.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Proposed intervention appears to allow for a much more
integrated understanding of CC, its causes and consequences. Study
describes two iterations of the intervention.

**title** Climate of Concern - A Search for Effective Strategies for
Teaching Children about Global Warming

## 123.1 abstract

Recent research suggests that the issue of global warming is one of
great concern for Australian children. This point to the need for
effective teaching about this issue. Children should be properly
informed about actions that help reduce carbon emissions as this may
give them a sense of empowerment and go some way to alleviating
concerns. This study followed the development in the knowledge of global
warming of 29 primary school students in year 6 (the final year of
primary) from two regional Australian schools over one school term. A
hands-on science unit dealing specifically with global warming was
prepared and taught over a period of eight weeks. A mixed methods
approach was adopted and data was gathered through pre- and
post-testing, through post intervention interviews. The findings of the
study indicated that after the unit, students had a clearer
understanding of the science of climate change, with the largest
improvement in student knowledge occurring where the students had
engaged in hands on activities or had effective visual aids. The data
also indicated that an increase in knowledge was accompanied by an
increase in levels concern in some cases. However, there was also an
overall increase in students’ belief about their ability to make a
positive impact in relation to global warming and climate change.

## 123.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study was undertaken to explore the prior knowledge and
understanding that final year primary students had about the issue of
global warming and whether a teaching intervention specifically
addressing that issue could improve this.

**Questions**:

1)  What alternatives or misconceptions do primary students have about
    global warming prior to intervention?
2)  Can a teaching intervention based upon a constructivist view of
    learning and critical theory improve primary students’ understanding
    of global warming?
3)  Will such an approach provide insight into students’ attitudes in
    regards to global warming?

## 123.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: true/false knowledge based survey instrument and semi
structured interviews

**Description**: Phase 1 involved a pre-test, a teaching intervention
and a post-test. True/false knowledge based survey instrument was
developed and administration to final year primary school students. The
second phase of the study involved interviewing a number of the
participants from phase 1 using semi structured interviews

## 123.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: The data from the pre and post administration of the survey
were entered into a spreadsheet and graphs were produced showing the
frequency of correct responses pre and post intervention. SPSS was used
to test for statistical significance between pre and post responses and
EXCEL to test for effect size. The two ‘attitude’ questions at the end
of the survey were compared in a similar fashion.

**Analysis**: participants were given a pre-test and a post-test. a
paired t test on the difference between the pre-test and post-test
results of each participant

**Results**: the quantitative results form the pre and post-test
comparison did not show a dramatic improvement in knowledge, they were
pleasing given the short period over which the teaching intervention
took place and the level of complexity of some of the concepts
associated with global warming

**Improved?**: understanging improved

## 123.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: yes (*Worked?*: no )

## 123.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Although the quantitative results form the pre and
post-test comparison did not show a dramatic improvement in knowledge,
they were pleasing given the short period over which the teaching
intervention took place and the level of complexity of some of the
concepts associated with global warming. This suggests that there is a
place for teaching this subject explicitly towards the end of primary
schooling.

**Message to keep:**: Interesting to note that there was an overall
increase in students’ belief about their ability to make a positive
impact in relation to global warming and climate change

**title** How does epistemological knowledge on modelling influence
students’ engagement in the issue of climate change?

## 124.1 abstract

Involvement in climate change has been proven to be hindered by
emotional and social barriers, as well as by conceptual difficulties
that students may encounter in dealing with scientific content related
to particular issues such as the greenhouse effect. In this study, we
start from the conjecture that behind many conceptual difficulties and
emotional barriers lie particular epistemological obstacles related to a
naive and stereotypical view of science. These include, in particular,
the belief that science still has the role and power to provide a
unique, unquestionable, and certain explanation of events and processes.
Such a naive idea clashes strongly with the intrinsic complexity of
climate science. This paper sets out to investigate if and how the
improvement of epistemological knowledge can influence behavioural
habits and foster students’ engagement in climate change. In order to
explore such an issue, we focus on five interviews collected at the end
of a teaching experience on climate change, carried out with secondary
school students (grade 11; 16-year olds). This study is a follow-up of
other two analytical studies aimed at investigating, respectively, the
impact of the experience on students’ epistemological knowledge and on
their behavioural habits.

## 124.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

NA

**Questions**:

- Did the improvement of epistemological knowledge influence students’
  behavioural and social attitudes and their personal involvement in
  climate change issue?
- If so, how?

## 124.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Classes, modelling, physics laboratory

**Description**: The teaching experience consisted of an after-school
laboratory course held in a science-oriented Italian secondary school.
The teaching materials designed and implemented in the course aimed to
foster (i) Deep understanding of the basic concepts involved in global
warming and climate change (disciplinary dimension), (ii) Critical
thinking about the Man-Nature-Society relationship in order to acquaint
students with past or current political and economic debates (societal
dimension), (iii)Appropriation of a refined epistemological discourse
where: i) controversies and scientific debates find legitimacy; and ii)
modelling in climate change is discussed and progressively framed within
the epistemological perspective of complexity (epistemological
dimension) 5 lab courses: 1. Introduction to climate change: scientific
research and new terms of the scientific controversy (general climate
science) 2. Experiments on examples of interaction between radiation and
matter (physics) 3. Experiments for the construction of a Greenhouse
Model (physics) 4. The epistemological perspective of complexity:
Introduction to the basic concepts for investigating complex systems
(mathematics and physics) 5. Political and Economic scenarios: overview
of climate treaties and proposals to cut emissions (political, economic
and sociological science)

## 124.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: During the implementation many different data were collected
to trace students’ development along each of the three dimensions
(disciplinary, societal, epistomological) $$studied more precisely in
other papers$$. $$Here$$ we focused on the five interviews collected at
the end of the teaching experience. The five students were chosen in
order to represent different attitudes toward the activities. Student 6
(S6) represents a “shy” person in the class, he actively took part in
the lab activities but he was not pro-active in the collective
discussions; student 13 (S13) represents the “excellent” student of the
class, he was much appreciated by the teacher and recognized by the
classmates as a leader; student 16 (S16) represents the “sceptic”
attitude toward climate change, he was not interested in the issue and
demonstrated mistrust toward the activities; student 25 (S25) represents
the “outsider” of the class, he was not particularly interested in the
activities in general and also in the climate change issue; finally,
student 26 (S26) represents the “thoughtful” attitude toward knowledge,
he was very heedful but silent throughout the whole process.

**Analysis**: $$More precise in previous papers$$ a fine-grained
analysis allowed us to identify some markers to make visible if and how
students enriched and refined their epistemological knowledge (Tasquier
et al., 2015). The markers concern: i) the use of the vocabulary,
i.e. the number and quality of epistemological words used by the
students in writing and talking about physical phenomena and their
modelling; ii) the patterns of argumentation used by students in talking
about the Model-Experiment-Reality relationship. $$Specific to this
study$$ Very descriptive analysis of the interviews. $$There is no clear
theoretical framework for the qualitative analysis, nor a very precise
description of the method$$ 1. we took into account the temporal map of
the single student in order to identify for each of them a specific
pattern of interaction between the students and the interviewer; 2) we
identified the main message expressed by the student about his personal
experience in the course; 3) we identified words or expressions that
each student repeated several times during the interview to express and
articulate their main message.

**Results**: Results pre-post (epistomological levels, disciplinary
achievement, and behavioral level $$intent$$): except student S6 (“the
Shy”) all 5 students accomplished a medium to high disciplinary
achievement, improved both their epistomological levels and behavioral
level $$intent$$). (results of each of the 5 students are analysed very
precisely, but it would take too much space to report here) Results from
the interviews (results of each of the 5 students are analysed very
precisely, but it would take too much space to report here): 2 groups of
students: 1. S25 (“the outsider”) , S16 (“the sceptic”) and S26 (“the
thoughtful”), both S25, and S26 accomplished a medium achievement level,
corresponding to a good epistomological improvement, but a low
behavioral $$intent$$ improvement. S16 accomplished a high achievement
level, coming from low levels on both epistomological level and behavior
$$intent$$ level but ended up to the best at the end of the instruction.
They were very at ease during the interviews and could express
themselves comfortably. From those 3 students: the epistemological
dimension and, in particular, the perspective of complexity was, in some
cases, productive intriggering a change in students’ attitude towards
climate change. Our three cases alone allow us to conclude that
significant. We correlations can be found between the epistemological
and behavioural dimensions and that the teaching path was able to
create, for some students, a virtuous dynamic state among them.
$$These$$ three cases concern students who had an initial distrust or
resistance toward climate change issues and found personal new reasons
for engagement in the epistemological perspective of complexity. 2. S13
(“the excellent”) and S6 (“the shy”). They were quite embarassed during
the interviews and did not enjoy so much, nor improved so much in
relation to the epistomological new way to present science.The other two
students acted as contrastive cases and allowed us to see some boundary
conditions needed to trigger personal involvement. These conditions
regard the need to master disciplinary knowledge in order to recognize
the value of the epistemological and social dimensions and the
importance of feeling free from the teacher’s expectations before being
able to explore and find one’s own position with respect to such complex
issues.

**Improved?**: There were an improvement in both behavioral $$intent$$
and epistomological knowledge. Moreover for 3 of the 5 students, the
idea of epistomological complexity allowed us to lower skepticism, lack
of interest, and distrust toward the topic of climate change.

## 124.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Epistomological levels (e.g. understanding of
complexity in the physical models) of the answers in the prepost test
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - decrease in the boredom, disinterest and distrust
toward the topic of climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: - the “behavioral level” corresponds to the willingness
to take action and change one’s lifestyle in order to prevent climate
change, together with a detailed explanation consistent with the content
of the course (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 124.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: There were an improvement in both behavioral $$intent$$
and epistomological knowledge. Moreover for 3 of the 5 students, the
idea of epistomological complexity allowed us to lower skepticism, lack
of interest, and distrust toward the topic of climate change. “Specific
epistemological know-how can positively impact not only productive
disciplinary engagement, but also a more personal and authentic
involvement in climate change.”

**Message to keep:**: The main idea of this paper is very interesting:
showing how epistomological knowledge (en particular the idea of
complexity in the physical modelling of climate change) can foster
engagement $$awareness, intent$$ toward climate change mitigation. And
it seems to work on 3 of the 5 students analysed here! $$My own
reflection; Maybe changing the discourse toward this kind of knowledge
on the roots of methodological controversies in science is more
efficient than the real classical knowledge of climate change?$$ Note
that it is difficult to use this paper alone because it is part of a
series of papers describing different aspects of the same pedagogical
experience

**title** The influence of causal knowledge on the willingness to change
attitude towards climate change: results from an empirical study

## 125.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the significant global challenges currently
facing humanity. Even though its seriousness seems to be common
knowledge among the public, the reaction of individuals to it has been
slow and uncertain. Many studies assert that simply knowing about
climate change is not enough to generate people’s behavioural response.
They claim, indeed, that in some cases scientific literacy can even
obstruct behavioural response instead. However, recent surveys show a
rather poor understanding of climate dynamics and argue that lack of
knowledge about causal relationships within climate dynamics can hinder
behavioural response, since the individual is not able to understand
his/her role as causal agent and therefore doesn’t know how to take
proper action. This study starts from the hypothesis that scientific
knowledge focused on clarifying climate dynamics can make people
understand not only dynamics themselves, but also their interactive
relationship with the environment. Teaching materials on climate change
based on such considerations were designed and implemented in a course
for secondary-school students with the aim of investigating whether this
kind of knowledge had an influence on students’ willingness to adopt
pro-environmental behaviours. Questionnaires were delivered for testing
the effect of the teaching experience on knowledge and behaviour.

**title** Promoting Climate-friendly Actions of High School Students: A
Case from Turkey

## 126.1 abstract

Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate a case in which various
extracurricular activities were implemented to promote high school
students’ climate-friendly actions. Research Methods: This study’s case
was the Green Team Student Club, in which 18 high school students
engaged voluntarily in different types of extracurricular activities
during student club hours throughout two school semesters. Data were
collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews, observations, and
document analysis of the student tasks. Findings: Findings revealed that
the students explicitly displayed climate-friendly behaviours such as
developing strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of their school,
becoming conscious energy and water consumers, and informing other
people about climate change while they developed action competence
through knowledge-construction (attending interactive seminars, field
visits, etc.), dissemination of knowledge (preparing posters, writing
articles for the school journal, etc.), and experiencing action
(calculating the carbon footprint of the school and developing
strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of the school, etc.).
Implications for Research and Practice: While the results may provide
insights for teachers and school principals about integrating
extracurricular activities within the schooling process, policymakers
can also use them in planning to create climate-friendly educational
settings. (C) 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved

## 126.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

“This study intends to evaluate the impacts of student-initiated
extracurricular activities in encouraging high school students’ action
competence regarding CC.”

**Questions**:

“What is the role of extracurricular activities in promoting high school
students’ climate-friendly actions?”

## 126.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Student club, with various activities

**Description**: Activities from the Green club: - knowledge: attending
interactive seminars, watching documentary videos, attending site
visits, critical observation of the local environment - communication:
poster preparation for school walls, article writing for public appeal -
action: carbon footprint calculation, developing an action plan to
reduce the carbone footprint of the school, adopting the action plan

## 126.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Interviews (main data collection instrument): individual and
face-to-face pre, reflective, and final interviews. (notes: 8 open ended
questions, reflective interview are conducted after each club session) -
observation form from the researchers and teachers - analysis of student
works (articles, posters etc)

**Analysis**: Qualitative content analysis

**Results**: All the result are analysed quantitatively, therefore,
expliciting here would be too long, however: - Knowledge improved
through various activities where the students asked specific questions
to the intervenants - Awareness improved, particularly on local CC
issues concerning the school, and toward all the school community -
Students took action and lowered the carbon footprint of the school -
the transport habits of the school community, however the authors note
that this was a very small improvement in the case of transport habits
of the teachers

**Improved?**: Knowledge improved through various activities where the
students asked specific questions to the intervenants - Awareness
improved, particularly on local CC issues concerning the school, and
toward all the school community - Students took action and lowered the
carbon footprint of the school - the transport habits of the school
community, however the authors note that this was a very small
improvement in the case of transport habits of the teachers

## 126.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Understanding of carbon footprint - developping
knowledge by asking question to intervenants concerning the activities
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: consciousness about the school carbon footprint and local
CC issues: - about the students themselves - toward the school
community - toward the transport habit of the teachers and the students
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**action**: - communication (posters on school walls and articles) -
designing and adopting a plan to reduce carbon footprint of the school
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**habit**: - personal habits of students and teachers (transport) -
reducing carbon footprint of the school through various habits
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 126.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “$$The authors show the positive$$ role of
extracurricular activities in promoting high school students’
climate-friendly actions”. “After active involvement in extracurricular
activities, students were able to develop and adopt an action plan to
reduce their school’s carbon footprint.”

**Message to keep:**: The authors present here a real strategy to fill
the knowledge-action gap, with extracurricular activities in a student
club. What is particularly notable is that the activities of the
students allowed to design and adopt a carbon footprint reduction plan
for the school which had a measurable effect

**title** Tackling climate-science learning through futures thinking

## 127.1 abstract

This study examined the role of a future-oriented scenario with
secondary school students using diorama construction which included
climate-change knowledge and envisioning alternative futures. To explore
the potential role of futures-thinking modelling, students from one
class participated in a 12-week cross-curricular inquiry with their
teachers. Jensen’s (2002) dimensions of action-oriented knowledge are
used to examine the climate-change knowledge developed by the students.
Four common images of the future (Dator, 2014) are incorporated as
models to forecast alternative futures. The findings suggest the value
of future-oriented dioramas for developing climate-change understanding
and futures thinking.

## 127.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To examine the role of a future-oriented scenario with secondary school
students using diorama construction which included climate-change
knowledge and envisioning alternative futures.

**Questions**:

1.  What existing ideas, experiences, and visions do students have about
    climate change?
2.  How do individual understandings change as students collaboratively
    engage in future-oriented model construction?
3.  How does future-oriented model construction, where students and
    teachers can communicate using climate- science ideas, impact on a
    cross-curricular inquiry?

## 127.4 Intervention

**title** Reshaping our world: Collaborating with children for
community-based climate change action

## 128.1 abstract

This paper documents a collaborative, multi-site participatory action
research project in collaboration with children to act on climate change
within local community settings. The project was an after-school program
that combined hands-on climate change educational activities with
photovoice, a participatory action research method that uses digital
photography as the basis for problem identification, group dialogue, and
social change action. Grounded in transformative sustainability learning
theory and integrated with an arts-based participatory action research
methodology, the program was designed to strengthen children’s climate
change awareness and sense of agency through youth-led action projects.
After describing the program, this article details the collaborative
action projects designed and carried out by 10- to 12-year-olds in each
community (e.g., policy advocacy, tree-planting, community garden) as
well as how the program facilitated children’s constructive climate
change engagement through children’s enjoyment and agentic action. The
critical importance of participatory process and collaborative action in
strengthening children’s sense of agency is discussed.

## 128.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study documents an after-school program designed for 10- to
12-year-olds that combined transformative educational techniques with
arts-based and participatory methodologies to simultaneously explore and
expand children’s role as agents of sustainable change within their
families and communities through youthled projects.

**Questions**:

NA

## 128.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Action research project

**Description**: The first four activities (i.e., introducing
ecosystems, climate vs. weather, and and collaborative action) were
action-focused. Activities were freely available online and compiled for
their alignment with program format (e.g., target age, length) and goals
(e.g., children’s enjoyment, action). Weather-permitting, several
activities took place outdoors, and some activities mirrored common
children’s games (e.g., energy bingo; greenhouse gas tag)climate
change). In SCA, photovoice methodology served to bridge educational
program content with youth-led action through art (Q. Wang et al.,
2017). Specifically, children were given digital cameras to capture and
express their personal connections with program topics. During monthly
photovoice discussions, participants, in small groups, told stories of
their photographs’ content and meaning. Following photovoice sessions,
children translated their collective commitments and visions into action
plans. SCA’s action component included: (1) the development of “family
action plans” to promote small-scale, everyday sustainable behaviors
(e.g., reducing energy use and waste) and (2) the design and
implementation of “community action projects,” through which children
were supported in realizing their visions for a collaborative project to
advance sustainability in the wider community.

## 128.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Focus group discussions

**Analysis**: Focus group discussions followed a semistructuredformat,
and were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and editedprior to
analysis using NVivo 10 software. Thematic analysis was used to
classify,organize, and describe children’s responses according to their
shared thematicproperties (Braun & Clarke, 2006).

**Results**: Throughout SCA, children’s sustained sense of enthusiasm
for the program seemed to coexist alongside their growing climate change
awareness and motivation for action. A key contributor to children’s
enjoyment of the SCA program — and which undergirds its transformative,
arts-based, and participatory dimensions — was the interactive (i.e.,
hands-on, experiential, action-oriented) nature of program activities.
Children enjoyed playing an active role throughout the program, rather
than being passive recipients of knowledge or mere “implementers” of
pre-determined forms of action. In this study, learning about climate
change strengthened children’s motivation for action, and their
participation in youth-led action projects empowered their sense of
agency (see Figure 2). In this sense, a second critical dimension of
children’s constructive climate change engagement was agentic action. In
particular, children’s sense of agency was supported by the “adult-like”
responsibilities undertaken during their collaborative action projects.

**Improved?**: Increase children’s engament on the climate change matter
throw the awareness and taking action

## 128.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: Rise awareness of climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**emotions**: Engagement and enjoyment of activities (*Worked?*: Yes )

**action**: Raising awareness about climate change and inspiring action
(*Worked?*: NA )

## 128.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Following the program, children had acquired new
knowledge about climate change and its local impacts, which gave them a
sense of ownership of the problem and its solutions. Most significantly,
the children in this study genuinely enjoyed themselves and developed
stronger beliefs in their agentic capabilities, while taking tangible
steps towards the sustainable transformation of their communities.

**Message to keep:**: This study focus on the importance of introduce
action reserch programs in wich students (children) can learn of climate
change and enjoying activities, but most important, tranlaste this
learning into action with their community and family.

**title** Merging the arts and sciences for collaborative sustainability
action: a methodological framework

## 129.1 abstract

This manuscript explores the possibilities and challenges of art-science
integration in facilitating collaborative sustainability action in local
settings. To date, much sustainability education is prescriptive, rather
than participatory, and most integrated art-science programming aims for
content learning, rather than societal change. What this means is that
learners are more often taught “what is” than invited to imagine “what
if?” In order to envision and enact sustainable alternatives, there is a
need for methods that allow community members, especially young people,
to critically engage with the present, imagine a better future, and
collaboratively act for sustainability today. This manuscript introduces
a methodological framework that integrates the arts and sciences to
facilitate: (1) transdisciplinary learning, focusing on local
sustainability challenges; (2) participatory process, bringing
experience-based knowledge into conversation with research-based
knowledge; and (3) collaborative sustainability action, inviting
community members to envision and enact sustainable alternatives where
they live. The transformative potential of this framework is examined
through international case studies from countries representing the
richest and poorest in the Western hemisphere: a multi-site research
study and after-school program for climate change education and action
in collaboration with children in the Western US; and a multi-cycle
research study and community arts center course for environmental
photography and youth-led water advocacy in Southern Haiti. Despite many
shared characteristics, case studies diverge in important ways relative
to the sustainability challenges they sought to address, the specific
context in which activities took place, and the manner in which
art-science integration was practiced. Across cases, however,
art-science integration facilitated participants’ learning, connection,
and action for sustainability. Framed by the shared aims of
transdisciplinary approaches, this manuscript discusses methodological
hurdles and practical lessons learned in art-science integration across
settings as well as the transformative capacity of alternative
pedagogical and research practices in building a sustainable future.

**title** Children’s constructive climate change engagement: Empowering
awareness, agency, and action

## 130.1 abstract

This mixed-methods study examined how ten- to twelve-year-old children
experienced and made sense of their growing climate change awareness
through an after-school program that used participatory methods to
facilitate children?s informed climate change action. The fifteen-week
program combined hands-on educational activities with digital
photography and culminated in youth-led action projects focused on
individual (i.e. daily habits) and collaborative change (i.e. community
projects). After the program, children knew significantly more about the
scientific and social dimensions of climate change than before, and more
than the average U.S. teen or adult. Survey and focus group analyses
showed that, in addition to learning, children were inspired and
motivated by their growing climate change awareness. Children felt
empowered by their knowledge and eager to learn more and take action to
minimize harms. Towards theorizing children?s constructive climate
change engagement, the importance of informal learning environments for
children?s intergenerational and political influence is discussed.

## 130.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Developing and evaluating methods that cultivate children’s constructive
engagement

**Questions**:

What were children’s perceptions of climate change before and after the
program? How did the program impact children’s climate change knowledge?
How did children experience their growing climate change awareness?

## 130.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Hands-on activities, digital photography, community projects

**Description**: 15 week after school programme - Science (6 weeks): 1h
eductional hands-on activities compiled from climate change educational
resources online - Camera : photovoice (photo-printing and discussion)
process (once every month during 3 months, interlaced with science
activities) - individual action (weeks 8-13) Family action plans (carbon
footprint and planning sustainable habits in the household) -
collaborative youth led action (weeks 11-15) depending on the 3 sites:
city council presentation and tree planting, photovoice gallery
exposition and program website, or community garden

## 130.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: before and after the programme surveys 2 additional post
programme open ended questions 11 focus group with 4-5 children, 38min

**Analysis**: Quantitative: Dependent sample t-tests on questionnaire
Cohen’s d effect size - Qualitative: Transcription of focus groups and
open ended survey items were analysed according to thematic analysis
(Braun and Clarke 2006)

**Results**: Children perception $$AWARENESS$$ of climated change: - 16
participants (29.6%) became more certain that climate change is
happening now, and 4 participants (7.4%) became less certain. However,
most participants (n 1⁄4 34; 63%) did not change their response over
time. - After the program, fewer than 1 in 5 children (18.2%) thought
about climate change ‘Not at all’ or ‘Not a lot,’ compared to 52.7% in
the presurvey. Of 55 participants, 31 (56.4%) reported thinking more
about climate change after the program than before, 11 (20%) less, and
13 (23.6%) the same amount. - Children’s certainty and time spent
thinking about climate change both showed statistically significant mean
increases following SCA Chidren climate change knowledge: - This
paired-samples t test showed a statistically significant mean increase
in children’s climate change knowledge following their program
participation - 68% of SCA children responded correctly to climate
change knowledge questions, compared to 56 and 59% of U.S. teens and
adults, respectively - quali: Compared to school, SCA was perceived to
cover the causes and consequences of climate change in greater depth.

**Improved?**: Awareness improved in aspects of certainty and thoughts
about climate change Knowledge improved

## 130.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness of questions concerning CC in questionnaire
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Certainty, thought and beliefs about CC as an
environmental and social issue (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 130.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Children’s average climate change awareness $$contains
knowledge$$ post-program had expanded beyond their own pre-program
knowledge, beyond the average U.S. teen or adult, and in some cases
beyond the boundaries of program content.

**Message to keep:**: In this after-school programme in somewhat low
income communities, the combination of hands-on educational activities,
photovoice process, and youth-led action projects allowed to reach a
level of awareness and knowledge that goes beyond average in teenager
and adult from USA. 2 details that may be interesting for the
synthesis - action is a trigger for knowledge and awareness, it should
not necesarily to be a later step in the awareness to action process -
knowledge gains beyond the scope of the educational interventions

**title** Science Education for Sustainability: Strengthening Children’s
Science Engagement through Climate Change Learning and Action

## 131.1 abstract

Scientists and sustainability scholars continue to make urgent calls for
rapid societal transformation to sustainability. Science education is a
key venue for this transformation. In this manuscript, we argue that by
positioning children as critical actors for sustainability in science
education contexts, they may begin to reimagine what science means to
them and to society. This multi-site, mixed-methods study examined how
children’s climate change learning and action influenced their science
engagement along cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. For
fifteen weeks, ten- to twelve-year-olds participated in an after-school
program that combined on-site interactive educational activities (e.g.,
greenhouse gas tag) with off-site digital photography (i.e., photovoice
process), and culminated in youth-led climate action in family and
community settings. Participants were 55 children (M= 11.1 years), the
majority from groups underrepresented in science (52.7% girls; 43.6%
youth of color; 61.8% low-income). Combined survey and focus group
analyses showed that, after the program, science became more relevant to
children’s lives, and their attitudes towards science (i.e., in school,
careers, and in society) improved significantly. Children explained that
understanding the scientific and social dimensions of climate change
expanded their views of science: Who does it, how, and why-that it is
more than scientists inside laboratories. Perhaps most notably, the
urgency of climate change solutions made science more interesting and
important to children, and many reported greater confidence,
participation, and achievement in school science. The vast majority of
the children (88.5%) reported that the program helped them to like
science more, and following the program, more than half (52.7%) aspired
to a STEM career. Lastly, more than a third (37%) reported improved
grades in school science, which many attributed to their program
participation. Towards strengthening children’s science engagement, the
importance of climate change learning and action-particularly
place-based, participatory, and action-focused pedagogies-are discussed.

**title** Climate change education for transformation: exploring the
affective and attitudinal dimensions of children’s learning and action

## 132.1 abstract

In response to growing recognition for the mental health impacts of
climate change, understanding the full range of children’s psychological
experiences in climate change education (CCE) contexts is critical to
developing approaches that support children’s constructive engagement
and overall well-being. Through surveys and focus groups conducted with
fifty-five children (ages 10-12), this mixed-methods study examined the
affective and attitudinal impacts of a multi-site CCE program that
encouraged children’s learning, reflection, and action. Findings suggest
that, through the program, children acquired stronger pro-environmental
attitudes, a deeper respect for nature, and a greater sense of urgency
towards the need for climate action. Importantly, children’s negative
emotions (e.g. fear, worry, anger, sadness) were mitigated by positive
emotions grounded in youth-led climate action in family and community
contexts. Findings are interpreted through theories of cognitive and
affective transformation, which shed light on the beneficial micro- and
macrolevel outcomes of children’s perspective shifts.

## 132.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The present mixed-methods research draws on survey and focus group data
to examine affective and attitudinal program impacts, ranging from
children’s perspectives on the interconnectedness of the natural world
and their place in it to their sense of urgency around climate action
and whose actions are critical to building a more sustainable future.

**Questions**:

1)  What were children’s climate change-relevant attitudes prior to the
    program, and how did these shift following their program
    participation?; and (2) How did children describe the attitudinal
    and affective dimensions of their program-based perspective shifts?

## 132.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Action research project

**Description**: Program activities took place for one hour per week
across three research sites. Based on the ‘Head, Hands, and Heart’ model
of Transformative Sustainability Learning (Sipos, Battisti, and Grimm
2008), activities consisted of three major program components: (1)
Science: hands-on CCE activities intended to make visible and concrete
the often invisible and abstract connections between Earth’s atmosphere,
local ecosystems, and the actions of people within their communities
(‘Head’); (2) Camera: digital photography according to the photovoice
ethod (Wang and Burris 1997), whereby children took and discussed
photographs representing their feelings about and connections with
program activities (‘Heart’); and (3) Action: youth-led action projects
inspired by their photography in both family and community settings
(‘Hands’). Family action plans, created and carried out by each
participant, consisted of everyday climate-relevant behavior changes.
Community action projects, collaboratively designed and implemented by
children at each research site (e.g. tree-planting; city council
presentation; community garden), focused on awareness-raising and action
at a neighborhood scale.

## 132.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Survey and focus group

**Analysis**: To address this study’s first research question, a series
of dependent samples t-tests were conducted to examine children’s
climate change-relevant attitudes prior to the program as well as
differences in these attitudes following their SCA participation. Before
analysis using NVivo 10 qualitative data analysis software, each focus
group discussion was recorded digitally, transcribed verbatim, and
anonymized for participant confidentiality. Thematic analysis, a
multi-step process, was used to analyze focus group data (Braun and
Clarke 2006). This process consists of data familiarization, initial
labeling of the data (i.e. ‘open coding’), identifying themes,
organizing and combining thematic categories, and finally writing
narrative descriptions of themes that ‘tell the story’ of children’s
experiences identified through thematic analysis.

**Results**: Overall, children felt greater urgency after the program (M
= 4.07, SD = 0.62), compared to before (M = 3.81, SD = 0.65). During
post-program focus groups, children were asked how their perspectives on
climate change shifted as a result of their program participation.
Children attributed to their SCA participation an increased sense of
respect for nature, feelings of intensified urgency about the need for
climate action, and a mixture of positive and negative feelings about
climate change rooted in their concerns and motivations to address the
issue through their own actions. Findings of the present study build on
previous articles in this series to show a range of positive impacts on
children who, through their program participation, gained awareness,
shifted their climate-relevant attitudes, and acquired a sense of agency
while working together on youth-led action projects to address climate
change in their communities (see also Trott 2019; 2020; Trott and
Weinberg 2020). There was evidence that children’s feelings of concern
were offset by positive emotions grounded in taking action on climate
change.

**Improved?**: Increase urgency of climate change after the program and
a mixture of positive and negative emotions related to climate change.
More positive emotions due to the hands-on project

## 132.6 Outcomes

**emotions**: Emotions are an important aspect of the climate change
education as is not only a matter of knowledge. (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: Change in the attitudes toward the urgency of climate change,
Environmental responsibility, ecological worldview, connection with
nature (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 132.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Findings reported in this study make clear the critical
importance of attitudinal and affective shifts in CCE. Whether or not
they are measured in every classroom or context, children’s
psychological and emotional realities are inevitably playing out
alongside the learning process. As this study showed, children’s views
of climate change are not always ‘doom and gloom,’ particularly when
knowledge is paired with opportunities for critical reflection,
dialogue, and action.

**Message to keep:**: Positive emotions can offset the negative feelings
of angry, fear, worry or sadness grounded on the use of yoth-lead
programs that take action on climate change. Also, they can contribute
to change attitudes toward different topics of climate change.

**title** Whose voices? Whose knowledge? Children and young people’s
learning about climate change through local spaces and indigenous
knowledge systems

## 133.1 abstract

This article reflects on collaborative research undertaken in Dawkins
Park Reserve, NSW, Australia. The aim of the collaboration was to
develop a local Indigenous cultural and educational outdoor precinct.
Participants involved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and
non-Indigenous teachers and primary (Year 6) and secondary (Year 7)
school students from three government schools and one catholic school.
Fostering student knowledge of, and stewardship about, the reserve’s
ecological biodiversity specific to climate change effects over time was
the desired outcome. In this article, we share the successes and key
challenges of using this park as a case study for outdoor learning as a
case study for outdoor learning about climate change in an authentic,
localised setting, and the contributions of Indigenous cultural and
scientific knowledge to the development of the students’ understanding.
Questionnaires and focus group discussions were undertaken with 174
students, while seven teachers engaged in focus group discussions.
Quantitative data supported the significant increase in learning
enjoyment outside the classroom and improved understanding of climate
change at a local level. Conversely, departmental policy and COVID were
identified as constraints for regular off-campus learning.

**title** Using Interactive Technology to Support Students’
Understanding of the Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming

## 134.1 abstract

In this work, we examine middle school students’ understanding of the
greenhouse effect and global warming. We designed and refined a
technology-enhanced curriculum module called Global Warming: Virtual
Earth. In the module activities, students conduct virtual experiments
with a visualization of the greenhouse effect. They analyze data and
draw conclusions about how individual variables effect changes in the
Earth’s temperature. They also carry out inquiry activities to make
connections between scientific processes, the socio-scientific issues,
and ideas presented in the media. Results show that participating in the
unit increases students’ understanding of the science. We discuss how
students integrate their ideas about global climate change as a result
of using virtual experiments that allow them to explore meaningful
complexities of the climate system.

**title** Free Public Species Naming to Promote Proenvironmental
Behavior?

## 135.1 abstract

To examine the impact of naming rights on support for environmental
protection, we provided a high school class the opportunity to name a
species of a parasitoid wasp after hearing a lecture on the extent and
loss of biodiversity, with special focus on species description and
climate change. Two other classes received the same presentation but
were not able to name the species. Results showed a small impact on
behavior, when controlling for environmental identity, with the
experimental group scoring higher than the other two groups. This effect
did not persist at a retest 4 months later. Other analyses showed,
however, that environmental concern and concern about effects on the
ecosystem had a significant effect on behavior at time 2 even when
controlling for behavior at time 1. Implications for educational
interventions are discussed. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

actually value nature. Concern about nonhuman environmental entities not
only predicts proenvironmental behavior but predicts continued increase
in behavior over time.

**title** “Sustainable City”: A Steam Project Using Robotics to Bring
the City of the Future to Primary Education Students

## 136.1 abstract

This article presents a STEAM project, “Sustainable City”, based on
educational robotics whose objective is to bring the problems of climate
change closer to primary school students. The participants were 30
students (aged 10–11) from 5th year of Primary Education and the project
consisted of 14 sessions in which different active methodologies such as
project-based learning, collaborative learning and the flipped classroom
were carried out. A pre-test and a post-test were carried out and the
results were better in the post-test, which indicates that the students
improved their skills and increased their motivation. As a conclusion,
this STEAM project, which is adapted to the Spanish LOMCE curriculum,
can be a reference for other teachers to bring their students closer to
the problem of environmental change through educational robotics and the
use of active methodologies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI,

## 136.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Robotic activity, lessons and debate

**Description**: Creating a sustainable city robotic board, with the
help of experts and teachers. Active methodologies are used in this
project, such as project-based learning, collaborative learning and the
flipped classroom (FC), in which the students become the protagonists of
the teaching-learning process and build their own knowledge.

## 136.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test/ post-test

**title** Sixth-Grade Students’ Progress in Understanding the Mechanisms
of Global Climate Change

## 137.1 abstract

Developing solutions for complex issues such as global climate change
requires an understanding of the mechanisms involved. This study reports
on the impact of a technology-enhanced unit designed to improve
understanding of global climate change, its mechanisms, and their
relationship to everyday energy use. Global Climate Change, implemented
in the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE), engages sixth-grade
students in conducting virtual investigations using NetLogo models to
foster an understanding of core mechanisms including the greenhouse
effect. Students then test how the greenhouse effect is enhanced by
everyday energy use. This study draws on three data sources: (1) pre-
and post-unit interviews, (2) analysis of embedded assessments following
virtual investigations, and (3) contrasting cases of two students
(normative vs. non-normative understanding of the greenhouse effect).
Results show the value of using virtual investigations for teaching the
mechanisms associated with global climate change. Interviews document
that students hold a wide range of ideas about the mechanisms driving
global climate change. Investigations with models help students use
evidence-based reasoning to distinguish their ideas. Results show that
understanding the greenhouse effect offers a foundation for building
connections between everyday energy use and increases in global
temperature. An impediment to establishing coherent understanding was
the persistence of an alternative conception about ozone as an
explanation for climate change. These findings illustrate the need for
regular revision of curriculum based on classroom trials. We discuss key
design features of models and instructional revisions that can transform
the teaching and learning of global climate change.

## 137.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

1.  Knowledge construction based on everyday experiences
2.  Understanding of domain-specific mechanisms and processes
3.  Scientific reasoning.

**Questions**:

1.  How do students conceptualize the scientific mechanisms associated
    with global climate change before and after interaction with the
    unit?
2.  What evidence sources do students draw from to support their initial
    ideas?
3.  How do students negotiate their everyday and instructed ideas as
    they study GCC?

## 137.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Web application

**Description**: This study draws on three data sources: (1) pre- and
post-unit interviews, (2) analysis of embedded assessments following
virtual investigations, and (3) contrasting cases of two students
(normative vs. non-normative understanding of the greenhouse effect).

## 137.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test/ post-test

**Analysis**: participants were given a pre-test and a post-test. a
paired t test on the difference between the pre-test and post-test
results of each participant

**Results**: Results show the value of using virtual investigations for
teaching the mechanisms associated with global climate change.
Interviews document that students hold a wide range of ideas about the
mechanisms driving global climate change. Results show that
understanding the greenhouse effect offers a foundation for building
connections between everyday energy use and increases in global
temperature.

**Improved?**: understanding improved

## 137.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increased knowledge (*Worked?*: yes )

## 137.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Findings show that developing a complete/normative
understanding of particular natural mechanisms and an anthropogenic:
energy-use-specific mechanism is necessary for students to integrate
their ideas about how human actions involving energy use relate to
increases in global temperature. This has implications for instructional
design that aims to foster an understanding of the role of human
activities in changes in global temperature and allows students to
create innovative solutions to the complex problems of global climate
change

**Message to keep:**: Future research is needed to explore the types of
strategies students use to conduct virtual investigations and how
interaction with models most effectively engages students in
evidence-based reasoning about global climate change-related mechanisms.
In addition, research is needed that informs the refinement of model
features and design of guidance that helps students develop productive
strategies to make sense of the mechanisms involved

**title** “Thank You for Being Republican”: Negotiating Science and
Political Identities in Climate Change Learning

## 138.1 abstract

When engaging with socioscientific issues, learners act at the
intersection of scientific, school, and other societal communities,
drawing on knowledge, practices, and identities from both in and out of
the classroom to address problems as national or global citizens. We
present three case studies of high school students whose classroom
participation in a unit on the politically polarizing topic of climate
change was informed by their political identities and how they situated
themselves in climate change’s sociocultural, historical, and geologic
context. We describe how these students, including two who initially
rejected human-influenced climate change but revised their
understandings, negotiating dissonant identities in the classroom
through repeated engagement with conflicting political and scientific
values, knowledge, and beliefs. These case studies problematize building
bridges between formal and informal learning experiences and suggest
that it may be necessary to leverage disconnections in addition to
building connections across settings to promote productive identity
work. The results further suggest that supporting climate change
learning includes attending to identity construction across ecosocial
timescales, including geologic time.

## 138.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

In this study we examine how students’ identities as participants in
political and scientific communities informed their participation in a
unit on the ecological impacts of climate change.

**Questions**:

- What scientific and political knowledge, practices, and identities do
  the students leverage as they participate in the ecological impacts of
  climate change unit?
- In what ways do the scientific and political knowledge, practices, and
  identities conflict, and how do students resolve these differences
  over time?
- How do the ways in which learners situate themselves with respect to
  social and ecological process across timescales inform their
  perceptions and valuing of climate change science and responses?

## 138.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, class discussions, data analysis activities, citizen
science participation, infographic communication

**Description**: “Ecological impacts of climate change curriculum”: 1,
introduction and context (1 week): introductive class discussion, media
exploration (youTube videos of scientists and politiicians), class
discussions about arguments and evidences, questions to scientists on
social media platform created for it 2. Evidence and Impacts (3 weeks):
going to local park 3 times to conduct field work related to
phenological shifts and contribute to the National Phenology Network, a
citizen science effort, research on a case study of climate impacts on a
local species using GIS and climate model data,experiment with Wisconsin
Fast Plant, analyses of time series data on atmospheric and oceanic data
with scientists, activity on ice core with scientist, calculation of
economic costs of affected ecosystem services 3. Infographic (2 weeks):
students used class data and their own research to construct an
infographic or visual display of data, feedback of the scientists,
revision and presentation

## 138.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Data sources included the following: ● Video observations of
Mr. S’s classroom (~30 hr, October 17–December 6, 2011) ● Video-recorded
exit interviews with the students at the end of the unit (30– 60 min per
student, in groups of two or three) ● Curricular artifacts, including
pre- and posttests, student work, student posts on the social media
platform, responses by experts to student work, weekly engagement
surveys, and digital photographs ● Qualitative field notes of classroom
activities (~80 pages)

**Analysis**: (Qualitative) We analyze how learners enacted and
constructed identities through a framework of Discourses that relate to
societal Conversations (Gee, 2011).

**Results**: Results are difficult to synthetise (detailed analyses of
the 3 cases over 42 pages, with quite a different objective from ours),
however the main ideas are: - Luke (republican with a climate denier
father) had to negotiate the conflict between the curriculum’s
scientific content and the political beliefs of his family, but change
his views about climate change and integrate knowledge about it -
Timothy (republican) was also very critical about the reality of
anthropogenic climate change. His personal identity as someone who was
good at science helped support his engagement with the evidence. This
continuity of this valued practice across settings ultimately supported
Timothy in negotiating tensions between the communities to which he
belonged and his continuing science identity work. Timothy participated
a lot in the debate, integrated a lot of the scientific processes and
knowledge and changed radically its view toward anthropogenic climate
change - Gareth (democrats with eco-concerned parents) thought that he
did not need to be convinced because of its democrat background. He did
not participate very actively in discussions, and ended up more or less
sure of the mechanisms of climate change, his statements demonstrate
that his understanding of climate change was a dynamic one influenced
both by the science he learned as well as by the controversy that he was
exposed to through social interactions in the classroom. However, he
deepened his understanding of both the scientific and political
dimensions, and as a result he wanted to continue to learn more about
thescientific evidence and the social controversy While actions and
intents were not central in the analyses, the authors noted that the 3
students were not very eager in taking actions against climate change,
for various reasons

**Improved?**: All students accepted the scientific reality of
anthropogenic climate change, however with some doubts and difficulties
to integrate this reality with their own political identities or the
environment of political debate surrounding it in USA. All students
improved in terms of scientific knowledge and understanding of the CC
processes. None of the 3 students seems eager to take action.

## 138.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Knowledge about the scientific processes and the
associated evidencesconcerning CC (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - Belief about anthropogenic climate change -
consciousness (and differenciation) of the political and scientific
aspects of climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: Willingness to take action or change habits (*Worked?*:
No )

## 138.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: While the class and activities had a positive impact on
the knowledge and awareness of the students concerning climate change,
it is important to consider the difficult negociation between political,
educative and social identities that CCE confront. To most effectively
support learning of climate change, research must better explicate these
interactions to support learners as they navigate communities and
negotiate identities.

**Message to keep:**: Very interesting and different article, the
authors show some encouraging results concerning gain of knowledge and
awareness, but what is really interesting is how this is accompanied by
very complicated negociations of identities in middle-class-USA, where
largely shared political positions are against the idea of anthropogenic
climate change. Moreover the authors mention that none of the studied
students is eager to take action, and it might be related to the
political climate of USA.

**title** Youth science expertise, environmental identity, and agency in
climate action filmmaking

## 139.1 abstract

The Green Ninja Film Academy (GENIE) is an interdisciplinary curriculum
development project that examines the efficacy of combining climate
science concepts and practices with digital storytelling for middle
school youth. We present findings from iterative enactments of this
design-based research project in 2017 (N = 296) and 2018 (N = 539). On
average, youth increased scores on assessments of science content and
practices while demonstrating competencies in filmmaking and science
explanations. Further, an inverse correlation was seen between initial
identification with the environment and change in environmental
identification throughout the unit. Results suggest that integration of
creative filmmaking into a climate science curriculum aligned to the
Next Generation Science Standards can increase engagement and science
proficiency particularly for youth who initially show less engagement in
environmental science.

## 139.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The GENIE intervention was designed to give students the opportunity to
tell their own stories about climate science in a meaningful way for
their communities.

**Questions**:

1)  to what extent, if any, the integrated science and storytelling
    curriculum impacted climate science knowledge and practice, (b) to
    what extent, if any, integrating science and storytelling impacted
    learners’ identity and agency with respect to climate change for
    learners with varied initial interests and identification with the
    environment, and (c) what aspects of the curriculum most engaged or
    hindered student engagement with climate science and storytelling.

## 139.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Interdisciplinary curriculum development project

**Description**: Here, we use pre-post assessments of climate science
disciplinary core ideas (DCIs) and practices, pre-post assessments of
identification with climate science and interest in and perceptions of
agency related to climate action, and interviews to examine the impact
of the GENIE intervention. The GENIE curriculum combines Next Generation
Science Standards-aligned climate science lessons with storytelling and
filmmaking and is designed to be completed in 4–8 weeks depending on the
teacher and classroom schedule. The curriculum begins with a video that
issues a challenge to students to learn about climate change and
communicate what they find out to their communities via a film in order
to help address the changes and impacts they discover. The second
section of the curriculum focuses on storytelling and filmmaking,
beginning with a Story Spine, a scaffold to aid in writing a good story.
Students use the Story Spine to break down a well-known folktale
(e.g. The Three Little Pigs) and then use the Story Spine to write their
own stories.

## 139.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Assessments, interviews and films and portfolios

**Analysis**: Science assessment: Percentage correct for each question
and mean scores on pre- and post-assessment science assessment for each
student population for each year were calculated; Identity and agency
assessment: Means of Likert-scale responses to items on the IAA were
compared for the full student population for each year. Means were
analyzed for statistically significant differences across the full
student population, by teacher and by gender; Student films and
portfolios: Student work was rubric-scored on a 12-item rubric with
scores ranging from 1 to 4. The rubric included categories related to
film content, technical aspects, and the science portfolio; Interviews:
Student post-interviews were transcribed and coded using an emergent
coding schema.

**Results**: Students who reported high levels of initial or final
identification with science also tended to report high levels of initial
identification with the environment. Students with low initial
environmental identification tended to have increased environmental
identification in the post-assessment, However, students with high
initial environmental identification tended to decrease in environmental
identification by the end of the unit. Most students noted that they
felt that they had an increased understanding of climate science after
participating in the unit. Several groups of students reported that they
appreciated learning about the science prior to making their films
because it gave their films richness they would not otherwise have had.

**Improved?**: The findings report more engagement of students throw the
curriculum activities, specially the filmaking.

## 139.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Science explanation, the authors consider that the use of
engaging activities in the intervention increase the capacity of science
explanation (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: The students report feelings of take action in their
lives and their community (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 139.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Students demonstrated improved understandings of
science, were engaged by the creativity and openendedness of the
filmmaking project and were proud of the work they had accomplished.
This work further suggests that this approach may be most successful for
engaging students who did not already have strong environmental
dentifications.

**Message to keep:**: This study presents an implementation of a
interdisciplinary curriculum that could help students to learn
scientific knowledge (e.g. concepts) throw engaging activities as
filmmaking and storytelling.

**title** Fear emotion reduces reported mitigation behavior in
adolescents subject to climate change education

## 140.1 abstract

Emotion has been recognized as a significant factor affecting climate
engagement behavior. However, empirical experiments testing emotions
influencing behavioral changes, climate change education (CCE) in
particular, are rare. In this study, we conducted a 2-week CCE program
with the support of video clips to induce emotions such as fear and/or
hope through the manipulated treatments and were then compared between
emotion plus lecture group and lecture-only group for adolescents to
explore how emotions affect self-reported mitigation behavior toward
climate change. The study involved 1730 students from nine middle
schools in three coastal cities (Xiamen, Shenzhen, and Ningbo) in China.
The results demonstrated that emotional video clips were the successful
stimulus for target emotions. There was a significant improvement in
both knowledge-gaining and self-reported mitigation behavior in the
lecture-only group, and climate change concern and involvement mediated
the effect on mitigation behavior. Compared to the lecture-only group,
the hope treatment group showed decreased knowledge gain but no
significant effect on self-reported mitigation behavior. In contrast,
emotion significantly reduced students’ self-reported mitigation
behavior in the fear treatment group, which was mostly pinpointed to the
behavioral change of emission reduction activities. Thus, the study
highlighted the importance of knowledge with appropriate emotions in
adolescents to safeguard educational outcomes.

## 140.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

exploring how fear or hope afects curriculum-based CCE.

**Questions**:

NA

## 140.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: lecture videos, climate change lesson

**Description**: pre-questionnaires and post-questionnaires The control
group only completed the pre-question- naires and post-questionnaires
without any intervention. The lecture-only group watched the lecture
videos but not the emotional clips. The lecture plus fear group watched
one of the four fear clips before the lecture video, and the lecture
plus hope group watched one of the four hope clips before the lecture
video.

## 140.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: NA

**Analysis**: Pre- and post-questionnaire

**Results**: NA

**Improved?**: Knowledge, self-reported behaviour (intent) improved BUT
not with fear

## 140.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Yes (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Yes (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: Yes (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: Learning and communication; Emission reduction activities
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 140.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: NA

**Message to keep:**: Lecture-only increases knowledge, self-efficiency,
positive intent concerning climate change. To achieve effective
educational outcomes from CCE, especially in the younger generation,
fear should be seriously considered as this can be counterproductive, at
least in Eastern culture. Hope is not a key emotion to act more.

**title** Changes in teacher attitudes relating to climate science

## 141.1 abstract

The establishment of the Next Generation Science Standards brought
climate science into standards-based education. However, teachers face
challenges implementing these standards, including a lack of resources
and textbooks, which may not accurately describe climate science or the
forces driving those changes. A climate science workshop was conducted
to give teachers an agriculturally based climate change curriculum.
Using agriculture as the context for teaching about climate change
provided teachers with opportunities to tie local, real-world climate
change examples to their students’ lives. Teachers attending the
workshop expressed similar opinions to the general population ranging
from climate change denial to alarm before receiving the training.
Teachers’ opinions relating to climate science changed following the
presentation of climate science presented as an integrated component of
modern agronomic production. Teachers appreciated receiving facts and
being allowed to decide for themselves about the severity of the
changing climate. Contrary to what teachers reported anticipating,
communities considered skeptical of climate change claims were accepting
of an agriculturally based curriculum presenting climate change and
adaptation as scientific facts void of political agendas. © 2022 The

## 141.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The purpose of this case study was to describe changes in teacher
attitudes toward climate change and inclusion of climate science lessons
in their curriculum after attendance at a 3-day climate change
professional development workshop and teaching two units infused with
climate science principles focusing on soils and erosion presented as
part of the workshop.

**Questions**:

NA

## 141.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Professional development

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons

**Description**: Teachers attended a workshop designed to provide
laboratory experiences relating to climate change, soils, erosion, and
ecological cycling.

## 141.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: semi-structured interviews and qualitative analyses

**Analysis**: Qualitative semi structured interviews, before the
workshop and after (by phone). Qualitative analyses of the teacher
discourses

**Results**: Gaps in the teacher knowledge base were filled and teachers
felt more confident/motivated/concerned to integrate CCE in their
curricular teachings. The inclusion of CCE was easier than expected

**Improved?**: Qualitative arguments that the attitudes of the teachers
change, their views were more in agreement with the science, they taught
more about CC, this did not pose particular problems. Note that the
authors insist on the relevance of teaching CC in agricultural science
in such rural regions

## 141.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Fill gaps in teacher’s knowledge base (*Worked?*: yes )

**awareness**: Change in professional attitudes toward more teaching of
climate change, and consciousness that it is a topic that may be taught
in their specialty, without the previously imagined dificulties.
(*Worked?*: yes )

## 141.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Two factors emerged in this study: (a) agriculture was
a good context for delivering the complex science concepts of climate
change and (b) locally relevant climate science was accepted, even among
those considered skeptical of its legitimacy. These pose opportunities
for curriculum designers and teachers implementing the NGSS.
Additionally, the combination of agriculture and climate science
represents a good application of cross-cutting concepts and helps
eliminate silos of instruction.

**Message to keep:**: The authors analysed qualitatively the impact of a
workshop on teaching CC in agriculture science, also after the teachers
got back to classes and could apply their newly acquired knowledge

**title** As the climate changes: Intergenerational actionbased learning
in relation to flood education

## 142.1 abstract

It is a concern that children represent an under-researched group in
flood education and preparedness because as adults they are more likely
to experience flooding as the climate changes, and because it suggests
their potential today, as agents of change, is being undervalued. Using
action-based, participatory methodology with seven to nine-year-old
children, a creative and inclusive flood education resource was
developed as a stimulus for learning. Evaluation revealed that young
children can learn about flooding and preparedness, and that
intergenerational learning from child to parent can also occur, with
children transferring the messages learned in school to home. However,
thematic analysis suggests key factors such as family relationships
(empowerment of children) and the parents’ disconnection and
dissociation from risk limit the success of intergenerational learning.
The implications of these in relation to flood education, flood
preparedness, and household resilience levels are explored.

## 142.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

1.  to evaluate the impact of a specific creative intervention on
    children’s learning and subsequent agency in flood preparedness
    within the household,
2.  to explore the potential of young children to educate and affect
    change within their families and communities through
    intergenerational and inter-community learning.

**Questions**:

does not specify

## 142.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Educational activities

**Description**: 1. Phase 1 included children working with the
researcher in school in small groups on a co-curricular activity
facilitated by a PowerPoint presentation constructed by the researcher
and informed by guidance from the environmental regulator providing
local and global examples of flooding. 2. In phase 2, one week later,
the researcher returned to school and children were individually
interviewed. The researcher thanked the class and explained how useful
the children’s involvement in the research had been, reassuring them
that they had “helped us to understand more about how to help families.”

## 142.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test/ post-test

**Analysis**: participants were given a pre-test and a post-test. a
paired t test on the difference between the pre-test and post-test
results of each participant

**Results**: Evaluation revealed that young children can learn about
flooding and preparedness, and that intergenerational learning from
child to parent can also occur, with children transferring the messages
learned in school to home. However, thematic analysis suggests key
factors such as family relationships (empowerment of children) and the
parents’ disconnection and dissociation from risk limit the success of
intergenerational learning.

**Improved?**: better understanding

## 142.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increased knowledge (*Worked?*: yes )

## 142.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: This article addresses an acknowledged gap in flood
education research and learning for resilience by young children and
their families. Using an action-based, participatory methodology, a
creative and inclusive flood education resource was developed as a
stimulus for learning. Children expressed interest and enjoyment during
the classroom session, and parents and teachers reported that this
enthusiasm had persisted beyond the initial engagement. Knowledge
retention by children was high, with notable levels of empathy and
understanding about the negative impacts of flooding evident during, and
after, the initial session.

**Message to keep:**: Public policy should explicitly recognize the
value and potential contribution of children in household resilience
planning. Secondly, similar approaches using a range of age-appropriate
materials should be trialed for a greater range of ages, and in a
variety of socioeconomic and flood-risk settings. These could include
multiple learning interventions over a longer timeline, and more
detailed evaluation of the factors promoting or limiting
intergenerational learning and translation of knowledge into household
action

**title** LINKING CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF A
KITE-BORNE REMOTE SENSING SYSTEM: LINKING CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION AND
REMOTE SENSING

## 143.1 abstract

A majority of secondary science teachers are found to include the topic
of climate change in their courses. However, teachers informally and
sporadically discuss climate change and students rarely understand the
underlying scientific concepts. The project team developed an innovative
pedagogical approach, in which teachers and students learn climate
change concepts by analyzing National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) global data collected through satellites and by
imitating the NASA data collection process through NASA Airborne Earth
Research Observation Kites And Tethered Systems (AEROKATS), a kite-borne
remote sensing system. Besides AEROKATS, other major components of this
system include a web-collection of NASA and remote sensing data and
related educational resources, project-based learning for teacher
professional development, teacher and student field trips, iOS devices,
smart field data collector apps, portable weather stations, probeware,
and a virtual teacher collaboratory supported with a GIS-enabled mapping
portal. Three sets of research instruments, the NASA Long-Term
Experience-Educator End of Event Survey, the Teacher End of Project
Survey, and the pre-and-post-Investigating Climate Change and Remote
Sensing (ICCARS) project student exams, are adapted to study the
pedagogical impacts of the NASA AEROKATS remote sensing system. These
findings confirm that climate change education is more effective when
both teachers and students actively participate in authentic scientific
inquiry by collecting and analyzing remote sensing data, developing
hypotheses, designing experiments, sharing findings, and discussing
results.

**title** An impact assessment of disaster education on children’s flood
risk perceptions in China: Policy implications for adaptation to climate
extremes

## 144.1 abstract

Background: Children’s flood risk perceptions that include their
awareness and behaviors, can be cultivated through disaster education,
which is crucial for improving disaster resilience and adaptation to
climate extremes. However, education’s co-influencing effect along with
family and society was unclear. This study investigated a three-year
disaster education program conducted in schools in Sichuan Province,
China.

## 144.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

1)  To identify and describe the key components of children’s risk
    perceptions and their impact factors; (2) to identify the three-year
    intervention effect by categorizing different levels of parent-child
    interactions and left behind status; (3) to assess the effectiveness
    of school education and social-network based education on children’s
    risk perceptions; (4) to explore their co-influencing mechanisms
    with risk-related parent-child interactions.

**Questions**:

1)  school-based education, social-network based education, parent
    accompaniment, and risk-related parent-child interactions have
    direct positive effects on children’s flood risk perceptions; 2)
    there is a positive interaction effect between disaster education
    and risk-related parent-child interaction on children’s flood risk
    perceptions; and, 3) risk-related parent-child interaction has a
    moderation effect between the disaster education and flood risk
    perceptions.

## 144.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Disaster education program

**Description**: The disaster education program was implemented in three
pilot areas, as these counties were exposed to risk of frequent floods,
mudslides, and landslides, caused by heavy rain storms attributed to
their mountainous areas and dense network of rivers. Disaster reduction
education was explicitly incorporated into China’s education system
after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008.

## 144.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Questionnaire

**Analysis**: Ordinary Least Square Regression (OLSR) was applied to
identify the effects, if any, of school education (classroomeducation,
propaganda poster, and professional guidance), social-network based
education (television, radio, friends, and internet), and risk-related
parent-child interactions on the children’s flood risk perceptions in
the year of 2018; Score Matching Method (PSM)

**Results**: Our results implied that the disaster education including
classroom education, propaganda posters, and professional guidance had a
positive effect on children’s flood risk perceptions and, comparatively,
classroom education had the most significant effect. School is not only
a haven to protect children from risks, but also could provide an
effective platform for the transfer of the information, knowledge and
skills that can increase their awareness and teach behaviors to cope
with these disaster risks (Olowokere and Okanlawon, 2014; Powell and
Holleran-Steiker, 2017; Christiansen et al., 2018). internet had a
significant effect on improving children’s flood disaster awareness,
while received knowledge from television and from friends tended to
promote children’s behaviors.

**Improved?**: Disaster education programa benefit children to the
awareness and improving disaster resilience and climate change
adaptarion. Increase knowlegde and promote discussion with community.

## 144.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increase knowledge of children contributing to change
their perceptions throw disaster education, making them more resilient
and adaptative to extreme climates. (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Children’s flood risk perceptions (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 144.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: To improve children’s risk flood perceptions,
social-networks and risk-related parent-child interaction should be
considered to be jointly conducted in disaster education. Integrating
parents into education programs is a more effective way to achieve
disaster risk perception, resilience and climate adaptation, even for
those left-behind children.

**Message to keep:**: The use of different strategies in the classroom
contributes to the awareness of students on risk perception, which is
crucial for improving disaster resilience and adaptation. In addition,
it is important the inteaction with parents in the process of risk
perception education.

**title** Effective education for energy efficiency

## 145.1 abstract

A lot of today’s world vices can be eliminated if certain targeted
modules and adapted curricula are introduced in the schooling system.
One of these vices is energy squandering with all its negative
consequences for the planet (e.g. depletion of finite energy sources and
the subsequent climate change). This paper describes the results of an
energy-thrift information and education project taking place in
different levels of education in Crete-Greece, which records 321
students’ and their parents’ routine energy-related behavior and proves
that this behavior changes to a more energy efficient one, after the
dissemination of relevant information and the participation into the
energy education projects. Namely, response percentages indicating the
energy-efficient behavior increased after project participation while
the ones indicating an energy-squandering behavior decreased. The
Wilcoxon signed rank test was statistically significant in all energy
behavior questions related to students and to most questions related to
parents. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

**Questions**:

NA

## 145.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: In-school lessons, field trips, games, artistic creation
(e.g. theater plays, museums…)

**Description**: Intervention great number of possible interventions
including specific lessons (includes specific audiovisual material,
books… ), games, exercises, drawings, filed trips to classic and
renevwable energy production units, art exhibitions… Specific
interventions to specific groups were not described but were presumably
adapted to student’s age and education.

## 145.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: self-administered survey completed both by students and
parents. Do you turn off the lights when you leave your room for more
than 2 min? Do you turn off the stand- by button of your TV set? Do you
use rechargeable batteries in your toys? Do you know beforehand what you
need from the fridge and therefore you open and close the fridge door
quickly? Do you turn off the air condition in rooms where there are no
people? Do you close the windows when the heating is on? Do you close
the windows when the air condition is on? Do you close the shutters,
shades or curtains to prevent the sunlight from coming in during summer?
Do you leave your room window wide-open for a few minutes for the air to
be renewed? Do you prefer showering to bathing in the bath? Do you check
that the water heater is turned off in time? Do you prefer going on foot
somewhere (e.g. school, afternoon private school, park) when it is
nearby? Have you seen to curtains or furniture not standing in front of
radiators? Do you fix your heating or air conditioning temperature at
maximum 20 °C in winter? Do you fix your air condition temperature above
25 °C in summer? Do you use special low electricity consumption lighting
bulbs at home? Do you receive central heating systems maintenance every
year? Do you check whether your fridge door closes properly? Do you cook
in a pot of the same size as the one in the stove in the cooker? Do you
put only as much water in the pot as you need? Do you fill up the
washing machine with clothes before you operate it? Do you check your
tyres’ pressure regularly? (Respondent answers if he has a car)

**Analysis**: NA

**Results**: Overall intervention appears to have worked in the expected
direction. No substantive difference acording to measured behaviour
except for few items: “Do you check that the water heater is turned off
in time?”, “Do you receive central heating systems maintenance every
year?”, “Do you check whether your fridge door closes properly?” and
““Do you cook in a pot of the same size as the one in the stove in the
cooker?” .

**Improved?**: NA

## 145.6 Outcomes

**action**: They concentrate on the following topics: the use of
electrical appliances at home, space temperature adjustment at home, the
water consumption, transportation, space temperature adjustment in
school, the rational use of heating installations, apparatus in school
and recycling. Furthermore, questions can be divided in 2 broad types:
one is questions about activities directly related to energy consumption
(e.g. turn off the stand by button of the TV set) and another one with
questions indirectly related to energy consumption (e.g. do you leave
your room window wide-open for a few minutes for the air to be
renewed?). (*Worked?*: yes )

**habit**: They concentrate on the following topics: the use of
electrical appliances at home, space temperature adjustment at home, the
water consumption, transportation, space temperature adjustment in
school, the rational use of heating installations, apparatus in school
and recycling. Furthermore, questions can be divided in 2 broad types:

questions indirectly related to energy consumption (e.g. do you leave
your room window wide-open for a few minutes for the air to be
renewed?). (*Worked?*: yes )

## 145.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Far reaching intervention seems to work by
simultaneously intervening a great number of variables.

**Message to keep:**: Very far reaching intervention using a great
number of coordinated sections presumably adapted to different audiences
seems to be effective. Could be difficult to implement and requires a
large number of coordinated actors.
