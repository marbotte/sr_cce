**title** Fostering senior primary school students’ understanding of
climate change in an inquiry-based learning environment

## 1.1 abstract

This quasi-experimental study explored the impact of inquiry-based
instruction on students’ conceptions of climate change and their
perceptions of science learning environment. A total of 68 senior
primary school students participated into the study. Data sources
included Questionnaire on Global Climate Change and Constructivist
Learning Environment Survey. Data were coded and analysed using
quantitative procedures. Before the instruction, about 25% of the
participants were aware of the major consequences of, causes of and
possible cures for climate change. Following the instruction, about
50–85% of the participants developed scientific understandings about
climate change, but the participants showed slow progress in terms of
identifying nonscientific conceptions concerning climate change. In
addition, students perceived inquiry-based learning environment more
encouraging compared to their regular science classes. © 2020 ASPE.

## 1.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study intended to explore the impact of inquiry-based instruction
on senior primary school students’ conceptions of climate change and
their perceptions of science learning environment as they experience
such an instruction.

**Questions**:

(RQ1) What are the frequencies of conceptions concerning consequences
of, causes of, and cures for climate change exhibited by senior primary
school students before and after the instruction? (RQ2) In what ways do
senior primary school students’ understanding of climate change differ
from pre to postinstruction? (RQ3) In what ways do senior primary school
students’ perceptions of science learning environment differ from pre to
postinstruction?

## 1.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons and activities

**Description**: 6 lessons, lasting 12 class hours in total. Each lesson
intended to address one aspect of climate change. The entire instruction
was designed utilising the 5E learning cycle, a form of guided inquiry,
and each lesson employed the levels of either structured
(predict-observe-explain) or guided inquiry. There are some hands on
activities - Experience on controlled acidity and seashells
dissolution - Experience on melting ice in water or on rocks -
calculation of personal carbon footprint - discussion about ethics of
science

## 1.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test/post-test

**Analysis**: Questionnaire on global climate change, coded 0 (false),
1(I dont know) and 2 (true) Score are calculated and tested with paired
t-test Effect size are calculated with Cohen’s d

**Results**: RQ1, Consequences of climate change : Following the
instruction, about 75–85% of the participants developed scientific ideas
about the major consequences of climate change, and they were able to
connect the idea of desertification with the climate change (see Table
1). However, the progression in connecting the ideas of flooding and
having more bugs and pests on crops with climate change was not as
dramatic as the other scientific ideas. RQ1, causes of climate change:
Following the instruction, more than 50% of the participants developed
scientific understandings about the major causes of climate change, and
in total, about 75–80% of the participants were sure that the climate
change is caused by the large amount of carbon dioxide released into the
atmosphere. RQ1 cures of climate change: Following the instruction,
70–80% of the participants developed the idea about the frequently
recognised cures for climate change such as planting trees, recycling
paper and rarely using cars for transportation. RQ2 Students
understanding of climate change: A paired samples t-test of the
participants’ pre and postquestionnaire total scores indicated a
statistically significant change toward a scientific understanding of
global climate change (t = −13.779,p \< .01) (see Table 4) The
participant answered also better to questions which were not from the
lessons or related to school programs the authors give this
interpretation: The participants, who provided scientific responses on
the questionnaire, may have either been guessed or learned from other
sources based their individual efforts.

**Improved?**: Better knoeledge and concepts concerning climate change
(consequences, causes, cures)

## 1.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Increased right conceptions about climate change after
lessons Better understanding of climate change Note: it does not concern
only the topics of the lesson but also other topics (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 1.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The instructional features, such as involving in
first-hand experiences, making sense of certain phenomena based on
collected evidence and sharing and discussing understandings, and coming
up with common agreement on certain issues on climate change, which
fostered the expansion of conceptions in students’ conceptual framework

**Message to keep:**: Classical example of science club activities on
Climate change. Note: the fact that students learned about the effect of
climate change on crop pest while it was not a topic in the science
club, nor in classes might be worth noting for the synthesis

**title** Investigating Preservice Elementary Science Teachers’
Understanding of Climate Change from a Computational Thinking Systems
Perspective

## 2.1 abstract

There is a need to approach environmental education (EE) topics, such as
climate change, with a framework that productively reflects its inherent
complexity. This study investigates how computational thinking (CT),
specifically systems thinking (ST), may prepare educators to teach
climate change. As scientists increasingly rely on computational
techniques in their studies of complex EE topics, it is incumbent on
science education to provide learners with computational thinking
opportunities. We investigated how elementary preservice teachers (PSTs)
in a science methods course (N=35) adapted a curricular resource on the
climate change topic of sea level rise to integrate the CT practice of
ST. Changes in their thinking were analyzed. Findings suggest that PSTs
prior to instruction held a limited understanding of climate systems,
often conflating weather and climate. Post instruction, their thinking
expanded to consider the relationships between carbon dioxide, global
warming, ice melt, and sea level rise. Further, many were able to
describe these systems in a future EE teaching activity for young
learners. A major implication was the need to develop a continuum of CT
practices for elementary educators, with an emphasis on ST, for complex
environmental education topics, that could frame their pedagogical
thinking for climate change education. © 2019 by the authors.

## 2.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The goal of this study was to determine how preservice teachers (PSTs)
learn about a complex EE topic like climate change, and how they planned
to incorporate the topic in their own teaching, supported by a CT
framework

**Questions**:

1.  How does computational thinking, with an emphasis on systems
    thinking, support preservice elementary teachers’ thinking about
    climate change, a complex environmental education topic?
2.  How do preservice elementary teachers incorporate systems thinking
    in their proposed teaching of the environmental education topic of
    sea level rise?

## 2.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Professional development

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons with computational tools (system thinking with,
punctually the help of software), online activities

**Description**: This study focuses on 2 weeks (10 and 11) from the
science method course for undergraduate preservice teachers. - week 10:
Climate change and computational thinking: PSTs learn about assessment
in the context of weather and climate change with an emphasis on the CT
practice of systems thinking - week 11: Blended learning, Sea Level Rise
and computational thinking: PSTs continue with assessment and climate
change with a focus on technology and blended learning. PSTs complete an
online activity on sea level rise and how it will affect a geographic
community using data and projections from the Surging Seas website
(Climate Central, 2018)

## 2.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Before and after session 1, preservice teachers were asked to
respond online to the prompt: “List up to three science related
questions you have about climate systems and climate change. This might
involve the interrelationships between factors, how different factors
affect each other, or connections between humans and climate change.”
Data were collected and coded for the number and type of systems in
their pre and post responses. independent interrater agreement was
approximately 90%, with subsequent negotiation among the three raters
resulting in over 95% agreement. After session 2, they responded to the
following prompt: “Within the context of climate change, what
systems/systems models do you now know inform a scientific understanding
of sea level rise, and how would you use such models to teach upper
elementary students how scientists think about the causes of sea level
rise with an emphasis on systems thinking?” Using the instrument
developed earlier, responses were coded and codes tabulated. While data
were not collected prior to instruction for this prompt, the use of the
same codes allowed for comparison with their responses in the previous
section The researchers realized later that the preservice teachers did
not mention fossil fuels in their responses in session 1 and 2. Data
were collected from four PSTs using selected questions from the CSKAI
(Drewes, et al., 2017) to gain a sense of PSTs’ understanding of the
role of fossil fuels in climate change

**Analysis**: Qualitative data are coded into categories, but the
results are very descriptive, and no particular methodological approach
is described

**Results**: Pre-post session 1: - The primary change in PSTs’ questions
before and after instruction was a shift from an emphasis on the
relationship between weather and climate change towards the greenhouse
effect and the role of greenhouse gases. - PSTs shifted towards a more
mechanistic view of climate change, involving CO2 and the greenhouse
effect, their view was still constrained and might not include key
relationships between the systems involved in climate change.
Post-session 2 (Sea level rise) - their understanding developed further
to include global warming, ice melt, and sea level rise. - weather was
no longer present in their responses, suggesting they no longer
considered it a primary component of climate change. - Still absent from
their responses was the relationship between fossil fuels and other
drivers of climate change. Additional questionnaire on fossil fuels: -
The PSTs’ responses to the selected CSKAI questions indicated they
understand the connection between the use of fossil fuels, CO2, and
global warming

**Improved?**: Cognitive approach of climate change improve toward a
more structured mechanistic view

## 2.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Computational/system thinking abilities concerning
Climate Change (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 2.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Overall, we assert that it is beneficial to incorporate
CT to meaningfully enact the NGSS as well as to prepare young learners
with the expected disciplinary core knowledge, practices, and cross
cutting concepts that apply across a wide range of disciplines involving
computation

**Message to keep:**: Computational/system thinking is an important
aspect to consider when teaching climate change, in this example, it
helped pre-service teachers go beyond weather and start thinking more
systematically and mechanistically about climate change. A less central
result might be interesting to keep in mind: in this study the focus
given to system thinking on the macroscopic Sea Level Rise process
caused the student to not think about the causes of greenhouse gas
(burning fossil fuels) in their discourse.

**title** Teaching the role of forests in mitigating the effects of
climate change using outdoor educational workshop

## 3.1 abstract

Background It is now essential for students to learn in the science
classroom about climate change and the part they can play in
ameliorating its consequences. This requires science teachers to have a
secure understanding of climate change. Purpose The aim of this study is
to investigate the effectiveness of a two-day outdoor educational
workshop on preservice teachers’ awareness of climate change and the
role of forests in mitigating the effects of climate change.
Participants 20 pre-service teachers voluntarily participated in the
workshop. Design and method A one-group pre-and post-test design was
used to investigate the changes in preservice teachers’ cognitive
structures after attending the workshop. Data were collected using a
word association test (pre and post) and participants’ reflection forms
(post). The cut-off technique was used in analysing the word association
test and thematic analysis was used in analysing participants’
reflection forms. Results The results indicated that the workshop
stimulated preservice teachers’ cognitive structures and conceptual
understandings of climate change. Moreover, they generally had positive
opinions about the workshop activities, emphasizing that these increased
their awareness and empathy skills. However, they also indicated a small
range of negative factors including a lack of time, materials, and
opportunity to debate, and being tired. Conclusions Non-formal outdoor
learning programmes can promote learning and increase preservice
teachers’ awareness with respect to climate change.

**title** Arguemntation in a Socioscientific Context and its Influence
on Fundamental and Derived Science Literacies

## 4.1 abstract

This study explored the effects of arguing to learn in a socioscientific
context on the fundamental and derived components of reading, writing,
and science understanding as integral parts of science literacy. We
adopted mixed-methods in which the 1-group pretest-posttest design with
supplemental interviews and questionnaires. The pretest evaluated the
dependent variables (reading and writing scores), the treatment was
arguing to learn about the global climate change issue, the posttest
evaluated the dependent variables, and follow-up questionnaires and
interviews informed the quantitative results. An intact grade six class
(N = 28) at an urban elementary school located in central Taiwan was the
participants. Analyses of the pretest-posttest gain scores and
correlations between these outcomes revealed significant (p \< 0.05)
improvements in writing and associations among reading, writing, and
arguing to learn. Interpretation of the qualitative data (interview and
questionnaire responses) supported that argumentation as an
instructional treatment focused on fundamental literacy could play a
positive role in facilitating students’ enhanced science understanding
(derived literacy).

## 4.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

NA

**Questions**:

1)  Could arguing to learn about global climate change as fundamental
    literacy enhance the fundamental and derived literacy components of
    reading, writing, and understanding?
2)  What were the correlations between these fundamental and derived
    literacy components?
3)  What were the qualitative benefits of using arguing to learn (focus
    on fundamental literacy practices) to enhance students’ fundamental
    literacy practices and science understanding?

## 4.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons, “Arguing to learn”

**Description**: This 7-week study included three phases:
reading–writing activity/pretest, arguing to learn/treatment, and
reading–writing activity/posttest. Week 2 and the remaining class time
in weeks 1, 3, and 4 were focused on the textbook and teaching the
Weather unit. 1. Phase 1 focused on fundamental literacy practices and
science understanding that involved directed activities related to texts
(DARTs; Wellington & Osborne, 2001) and to complete a global climate
change reading–writing worksheet. DARTs utilized the
constructive–interpretative language arts pair of reading–writing and
integrated the literacy practices of learning to read and write. 2.
Phase 2, the instruction phase (90 min in week 3), used arguing to learn
about socioscientific issues and focused on learning and using
fundamental literacy practices. After the warm-ups, the students were
arranged to individually finish the arguing-to-learn worksheet 2 days
later within 30 min during the single class period. The teacher
encouraged students to actively use the learned skills, but he did not
provide any answers related to Fig. 2; this process focused on students
using the argumentation task (a fundamental literacy practice) they had
learned and the literacy practices about the global climate change
issue. 3. Phase 3 repeated the phase 1 reading–writing activity and
posttest (90 min distributed in three class periods in week 4) using the
same textual materials.

## 4.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: ten question for text comprehension (true/false) PREPOST -
Essay writing scored using four dimension (content, organization, word
choice, sentence structure) PREPOST - Arguments cell in a worksheet
(arguing to learn in a structured worksheet) were scored as well (POST
activity ONLY) - Finally, qualitative data from the follow-up
questionnaires and interviews were analyzed. The questionnaire was
designed to collect all participants’ viewpoints and learning
experiences on (a) arguing to learn a socioscientific issue and (b) the
learning benefits from using argumentation as a fundamental literacy
practice in the global climate change context. Eight students were
randomly selected for interview by the second author as a case sample
(POST ONLY)

**Analysis**: Quantitative: Analysis of quantitative data involved
calculating descriptive statistics, testing gain scores, and exploring
the correlations among the variables. Paired-sample t tests were used to
analyze pretest–posttest changes in the participants’ reading
comprehension and essay writing. Pearson correlation coefficients were
used to analyze the associations between the fundamental and derived
literacy components in an attempt to investigate how these literacy
components support and complement each other. Qualitative: Using open
coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1998), two researchers analyzed the
questionnaire and interview responses; they read and coded all the
verbatim responses individually and then discussed their discrepant
codes to reach consensus. We employed triangulation to guard against
misinterpretation of data and to build credibility of the qualitative
data (Sadler & Zeidler, 2005)

**Results**: Reading Comprehension as Derived Literacy: The analysis of
pretest and posttest scores of reading comprehension related to science
understanding about the global climate change issue (Table 1) revealed
no significant gain, t = −0.124, p = 0.902. We had not predicted that
the effect of active reading from the DARTs reading–writing activity
would lead to high levels of science understanding on the pretest and
posttest (8.68, 8.71, respectively, out of ten possible points). Thus,
this ceiling effect limited the potential learning influence from using
argumentation in supporting students’ reading comprehension Essay
Writing as Fundamental Literacy: Analysis of the pretest and posttest
essay writing scores related to fundamental literacy practices (Table 1)
revealed significant gains. The paired-sample t test of the students’
performance on all of the posttest scoring items demonstrated
significant (p \< 0.05) progress over the pretest performance. The
improvement on the total essay writing score was a large effect size, d
= 1.43; the improvement on the content item was a medium effect size, d
= 0.57; and the improvements on the organization, word choice, and
sentence structure items were large effect size, d = 1.43, 1.29, and
1.22, respectively. These medium to large effect sizes meant that the
arguing-to-learn treatment likely contributed to the performances on
essay writing, organization, word choice, and sentence structure.
Benefits of Using Argumentation (Qualitative analysis): Three benefits
of the argumentation experience on learning to read and write at the
posttest phase were reported by the students interviewed: (i) ntegrating
argumentation experience with the reading–writing worksheet task
encouraged the students to determine and evaluate whether or not the
results were beneficial to global climate change, (ii) the experiences
of arguing to learn could guide the students to do structured thinking
by warrant/backing/rebbutal (pro) and W/B/R (con) when doing the
reading–writing activity in the posttest, (iii) the arguing-to-learn
experiences could encourage the students to consider the global climate
change issue for better and thorough science understanding

**Improved?**: Essay writing as fundamental literacy has improved Text
comprehension as derived literacy has not improved, but the pretest
score were so high that there were not much space for improvement The
students completed well the structured arguments in the arguing to learn
activity

## 4.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - derived literacy (reading comprehension on CC texts) -
fundamental literacy (essay writing) - capacity of arguing (structure of
arguments counter-argument etc) (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 4.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Through the activity of arguing to learn about the
global climate change issue, the students internalized the literacy
practices by combining reading and writing with arguing to learn, which
had significant teaching–learning benefits.

**Message to keep:**: In Taiwan, the use of an “arguing to learn”
pedagogical strategy seems to have a good impact in terms of “science
literacy” (writing/reading on climate change) on relatively young
learners (~11-12 years old). Note that the “arguing” part of the
intervention consisted in exploring a warrant/backing/rebuttal structure
on arguments and counter-arguments (in an excel worksheet!), not in a
lively discussion between students

**title** Bridging the Action Gap by Democratizing Climate Change
Education—The Case of k.i.d.Z.21 in the Context of Fridays for Future

## 5.1 abstract

Formal schooling frequently lacks both democratic learning culture and
effective climate change education (CCE). This study analyzes the
effects of the participatory CCE initiative k.i.d.Z.21 and the impacts
of the current Fridays For Future (FFF) climate protests on teenagers’
climate change awareness. The mixed-methods approach comprises online
pre-and post-tests, and personal interviews with selected students.
k.i.d.Z.21 follows moderate constructivist, inquiry-based learning
approaches and addresses 14-year old students from secondary schools in
Austria and southern Germany. Considering the effectiveness of the CCE
intervention of school year 2018/2019 (N = 169), quantitative findings
reveal an increased mean of major components of climate change
awareness, including climate-friendly behavior. When separating
participants and non-participants in Fridays For Future, personal
concern and refusing meat have both increased significantly only among
protest participants. A closer examination of this group identifies an
enhanced feeling of self-efficacy that might be triggered by perceived
collective efficacy. Besides, more climate-friendly consumption
behavior, as well as enhanced multiplicative action, are detected. The
interviewed students also clearly assigned increased action-related
components of climate change awareness to the attendance of FFF. From
the findings, we conclude that democratic learning in and out of school
can enhance action-related components of climate change awareness, and a
combination of both can have an even stronger effect.

## 5.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Evaluating the effect of the k.i.d.Z.21 programme and investigate
whether components of climate change awareness differ among participant
to the “Friday For Future” protest participants and non-participants

**Questions**:

NA

## 5.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular and extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lessons / Research projects / One week field trip

**Description**: k.i.d.Z.21 takes place during all the academic year
with various modules - kick-off workshop (plenary discussions with
diverse actors, transdisciplinary) - classical school lessons -
individual research projects - 3 modules in the “High alpine Research
Week” with experts (tourism, environmental ethics, vegtation, soil,
glacier etc)

## 5.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre- post- questionnaire 20-minutes semi-structured individual
interviews for 10 students who participated in the Friday For Future
protests

**Analysis**: t-test to compare pre- and post test effect size
calculated based on Bravais-Pearson, and Cohen interpretation Cronbach’s
alpha on the questionnaire to measure scale reliability Interviews were
conducted on students participating in “Friday for future” and analysed
with structured content analyses

**Results**: ((AWARENESS)) Awareness improved for all students, in all
the different aspect “Responsability” and “locus of control” were higher
for students participating in protests before and after interventions
The mean change of “Level of concern” and “self-efficacy” was higher for
students participating in protest ((INTENTION)) mean behavioral change
(engagement and multiplicative actions) improved for all students but
more in students participating in protest ((HABIT)) Change of diet
(refusal of meet) only occured in FFF protest participants, who also
mention consumption behavior change (88.9%) ((KNOWLEDGE)) Improved for
all students, but more in FFF protest participants

**Improved?**: Concerning awareness, knowledge, intention all students
improved, with higher improvement for the Friday For Future (FFF)
protest participants. Concerning habits, the improvement is particularly
seen in FFF participants

## 5.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness in questionnaire in question concerning
tourism, ethics, vegetation/soil and glaciers (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - Sense of responsability - Self-efficacy (sense of
competence) - locus of control (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: Part of behavior which is not related with particular
habits or actions (multiplier effect and general behavior change)
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**habit**: Behavior change such as diet, transport, consumption
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 5.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Climate change awareness could be enhanced by the
learning intervention of k.i.d.Z.21 in all students. Combination of the
educative interventions from k.i.d.Z.21 and the participation in the
Friday For Future protests can be mutually beneficial. Action-related
components of students’ CCA are strengthened, student motivation
increases, and practical skills are developed.

**Message to keep:**: Beyond a quite positive effect of the k.i.d.Z.21
one-year programme, on numerous students and on various outcomes
concerning CC behavior and awareness, the originality of this paper is
to show a potential complementarity effect of the student participation
in the Friday For Future protest movement.This show that the effect of
CCE is part of a complex environment which may influence children toward
change, and this might be the key for the knowledge action gap.

**title** Professional development design considerations in climate
change education: teacher enactment and student learning

## 6.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing society,
and climate change educational models are emerging in response. This
study investigates the implementation and enactment of a climate change
professional development (PD) model for science educators and its impact
on student learning. Using an intrinsic case study methodology, we
focused analytic attention on how one teacher made particular
pedagogical and content decisions, and the implications for student’s
conceptual learning. Using anthropological theories of conceptual
travel, we traced salient ideas through instructional delivery and into
student reasoning. Analysis showed that students gained an increased
understanding of the enhanced greenhouse effect and the implications of
human activity on this enhanced effect at statistically significant
levels and with moderate effect sizes. However, students demonstrated a
limited, though non-significant gain on the likely effects of climate
change. Student reasoning on the tangible actions to deal with these
problems also remained underdeveloped, reflecting omissions in both PD
and teacher enactment. We discuss implications for the emerging field of
climate change education.

## 6.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The research presented here reports on the design, pedagogical enactment
and subsequent effects on student learning of a climate change
professional development (PD) model in the United States. We focus
attention on how one teacher made specific curricular and pedagogical
decisions in light of her participation in climate change PD.

**Questions**:

1)  How did a middle-school teacher integrate climate change concepts
    into her science curriculum following PD participation?
2)  How did climate change instruction influence student understanding
    of key climate change constructs?

## 6.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Professional development

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lessons, discussions, experiments, outdoor activities

**Description**: Year-long climate academy programme for teachers
professional development: (a) an intensive residential week-long summer
institute (46 h); (b) four virtual follow-up sessions on challenging
climate change concepts; and (c) two face-to-face follow-up sessions
focusing on pedagogical methods for teaching about climate change

## 6.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: We engaged as active participant observers, both taking field
notes and interacting with participating teachers as they engaged in PD
activities. We collected daily reflections where all participants
reflected on what was learned, articulated remaining questions, and
noted additional supports needed. Finally, we collected the
implementation plans developed by all participants during the
residential summer institute. In addition to artefacts collected during
the Climate Academy, the lead author conducted classroom observations
for a period of two weeks, documenting Emma’s integration of climate
change into her existing instruction on Earth’s history and geologic
time scale through field notes and the collection of relevant student
work products. We also conducted interviews with ((the teacher)) both
pre- and post-instruction.

**Analysis**: An abductive analytic approach was implemented to examine
qualitative documents collected from the Climate Academy and Emma’s
instructional delivery (Tavory & Timmermans, 2014). Specifically, we
first used an etic coding scheme built The first author coded the
artefact corpus according to the four pre-established conceptual
domains. Initial findings from this stage of the analysis were
triangulated against additional data sources

**Results**: Emma acknowledged that she improved her knowledge of the
carbon cycle while gaining understanding of how scientists track CO2
levels in Earth’s past - Emma acknowledged gaining a better
understanding of ice melt and thermal expansion Other results: knowledge
in terms of pedagogy: - Emma remarked about the value of interactive lab
demonstrations on how changing ocean currents are influenced by
temperature and density on her understanding of thermal expansion. - she
gained a deeper appreciation of the role of outdoor activities for
experiencing climate change first hand. - She also gained a deeper
understanding of NGSS, the role of climate change in the new standards,
and potential resources for implementation in middle-school
classrooms. - she recognised the importance of empowering students to
act to set a positive tone when discussingclimate change

**Improved?**: Better knowledge concerning CO2 measurements in
methodologies and Sea level rise mechanisms

## 6.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Gain of knowledge concerning processes and scientific
methodology in climate change science (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: Pedagogical knowledge: using pedagogical strategies
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 6.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Good effect on knowledge on Climate change and the
pedagogical strategies to present it to the students

**Message to keep:**: The paper follows a teacher and her students. The
teacher goes to a professional development program and the researchers
evaluate her gain of knowledge (good both in terms of knowledge and
pedagogy) but also those of the students (good for basic knowledge and
processes but not enough in terms of mitigation and adaptation
strategy). “A climate change education that merely presents causes and
effects of climate change will remain of limited import and unable to
address the nature of the problem in its totality.”

**title** Professional development design considerations in climate
change education: teacher enactment and student learning

## 7.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing society,
and climate change educational models are emerging in response. This
study investigates the implementation and enactment of a climate change
professional development (PD) model for science educators and its impact
on student learning. Using an intrinsic case study methodology, we
focused analytic attention on how one teacher made particular
pedagogical and content decisions, and the implications for student’s
conceptual learning. Using anthropological theories of conceptual
travel, we traced salient ideas through instructional delivery and into
student reasoning. Analysis showed that students gained an increased
understanding of the enhanced greenhouse effect and the implications of
human activity on this enhanced effect at statistically significant
levels and with moderate effect sizes. However, students demonstrated a
limited, though non-significant gain on the likely effects of climate
change. Student reasoning on the tangible actions to deal with these
problems also remained underdeveloped, reflecting omissions in both PD
and teacher enactment. We discuss implications for the emerging field of
climate change education.

## 7.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons, discussions experiments, outdoor activities

**Description**: The teacher who participated in the “climate academy”
infused climate change into 2 classes in classical curriculum:
watersheds, and Earth geological history. - lessons on the difference
between weather and climate and the carbon cycle - lessons with
demonstrations (experimental) on ice melt and thermal expansion -
argumentative activity using concept cartoons, where groups of students
chose different perspectives, conducted their own research, and
discussed the strengths and weaknesses of that position. - discussion on
the effects of climate change both locally and globally with introduced
personal changes, like driving less and planting trees, that her
students could take to influence their own carbon footprint

## 7.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-post questionnaire on content knowledge assessment Both
the pre- and post-instruction content knowledge assessment included
short answer written response prompts so students could demonstrate
their reasoning beyond the basic multiple-choice selection.

**Analysis**: Dependent samples t-test with effect sizes (Cohen’s d) -
Student open response justification items were analysed qualitatively to
determine potential changes following targeted instruction. Findings
from this stage were also triangulated against additional data sources
for credibility purposes.

**Results**: Out of 18 possible points, on average students scored 8.6
points on the pre-assessment compared to 10.2 points on the
post-assessment (t = 4.138, df = 41, p = .001) - small but marked shift
toward a more accurate and complex understanding of the human mechanisms
causing climate change and what might be done to mitigate the effect of
those causes - In general students updated incorrect or partial
conceptualizations of how humans were impacting the atmosphere and were
then able to translate that under standing into tangible suggestions -
Results, however, indicated small differences in the climate change
constructs on effects and mitigation and adaptation strategies. (==\>
our results indicate that students remained unclear following
instruction about what to actually do about climate change given their
newfound scientific knowledge)

**Improved?**: better knowledge concerning anthropogenic climate change
and the greenhouse effect mechanism, not concerning Mitigation and
adaptation strategies

## 7.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness of knowledge test concerning: 1 Causal human
activity impact 2 Greenhouse effect mechanism 3 Mitigation and
adaptation strategies 4 Climate change effects (*Worked?*: 1 and 2: yes
3 and 4: no )

## 7.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Good effect on knowledge concerning reality and
processes of CC, but not on mitigation and adaptation strategies. “A
climate change education that merely presents causes and effects of
climate change will remain of limitedimport and unable to address the
nature of the problem in its totality.”

**Message to keep:**: The paper follows a teacher and her students. The
teacher goes to a professional development program and the researchers

pedagogy) but also those of the students (good for basic knowledge and
processes but not enough in terms of mitigation and adaptation

**title** A new approach of science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics outreach in climate change, energy, and environmental
decision making

## 8.1 abstract

Preparing a literate public to critically evaluate issues related to
climate change, energy, and the environment is an important pillar
toward more sustainable societies. In this article, we focus on how
informal education and outreach programs that have a combined focus on
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and on climate
change can improve knowledge, produce interest in STEM careers, and
prepare educators to communicate and teach issues at the crossroads of
STEM and climate change. The first part of this article describes the
structure of STEM outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers in
various parts of the United States. The second part presents, in detail,
the structure and results of the outreach program SUCCEED (the Summer
Center for Climate, Energy, and Environmental Decision-Making), a K-12
outreach program created by Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of
Engineering and Public Policy (EPP). SUCCEED aims to 1.) improve
scientific literacy through a summer program focusing on climate,
energy, and environmental decision making for students entering 10th
grade and K-12 teachers; 2.) encourage the pursuit of STEM-related
careers, and 3.) help teachers prepare curriculum in these disciplines,
to be used in their classes. This article also discusses how both the
university and the local community can benefit from outreach programs
like SUCCEED.

**title** Collaborative learning on energy justice: International youth
perspectives on energy literacy and climate justice

## 10.1 abstract

To explore the complexities of energy literacy in a global educational
context, this article draws on research from a 7-month collaborative
educational research project titled International Youth Deliberation on
Energy Futures (IYDEF), which engaged 207 high school students from 22
schools in 18 countries in developing the education needed to activate
just and sustainable energy transitions. Key to student learning were
activities to build an awareness of systemic global climate issues and
to develop energy literacy to understand unsustainable energy legacies
and envision alternative and equitable energy transitions and futures.
Based upon research from this global classroom case study, this article
argues for a collaborative, global effort to promote sociocultural
aspects of energy literacy as an underlying framework for energy and
climate justice.

## 10.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Drawing on a case study of an international youth energy education
project titled the International Youth Deliberation on Energy Futures
(IYDEF), this article discusses the possibilities and limitations of
linking energy literacy with climate justice (i.e., energy justice),
reinforcing the importance of creating energy-literate citizens

**Questions**:

- How do students from diverse international contexts experience and
  respond to learning for energy justice?
- How do these responses inform students’ understanding of the global
  context for energy transition and its relationship to the climate
  emergency?

## 10.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular/extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, discussion and online social interactions, local
research and collaborative projects

**Description**: Tools: TakingITGlobal online education platform,
virtual classroom containing curriculum material, student blog space,
WhatsApp, Skype, Messenger, Zoom, Google Doc. - Students began by
introducing themselves on the platform according to their own personal
and community energy access, use, and generation - Locally-focused
activities then drew students into their communities as they mapped
local energy sources and flows - They also considered the
interconnections between their individual energy footprints and those of
their communities and countries. - They compared their learning across
contexts through a series of collaborations with one another, studying
how histories,cultures, economies, geopolitical relations, lands, and
resources all situated them in relation to energyavailability, use, and
transition. - Students then met in three continental groupings,
consisting of (a) Africa and Europe, (b) Asia and Oceania, and (c) North
and South America. For their continental meeting, students examined case
studies and prepared presentations on key considerations for energy
justice, which they discussed together at the videoconference. In a
global videoconference, students reflected on their cumulative learning,
returning to the pressing issue of climate change. - Following seven
months of collaboration, a select group of youth, chosen by their peers
and representing all schools (except Finland, Kuwait, and Oman), came
together over video conference through a collaborative writer’s retreat
in April 2020. They developed a presentation, essay, and opinion
editorial piece to share with their home schools, communities, and the
greater public. Students discussed their key themes, structured their
various projects, and developed their ideas using content from the blog
posts to ensure representation of the full student group. Youth wrote
simultaneously and collaboratively using Google Docs over Zoom.

## 10.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Data were collected from several sources, including student
research artifacts, reflections on the project, and focus groups. The
data sources consist of the students’ video, “Global youth demand energy
justice: This is about YOU too,” their essay, “Together, we can make the
change: International youth deliberation on energy futures,” and their
opinion editorial, “Climate change as a pandemic: A pandemic called
climate change”. We conducted two focus groupswith 11 of the students
from the writer’s retreat workshops and gathered written responses from
seven students who were unable to attend the focus groups. Interviewed
students represented Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana, India,
Kenya, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Slovenia, South Korea,
and Uganda. Student interview questions focused on the impacts of the
curriculum on students’ understanding of energy justice, the role of
international collaboration on student learning, and youth visions for
the future, including their understanding of their roles in building
those futures. As interviews were conducted only with student
participants of the writers’ retreat, we supplemented analysis by
examining work and responses by the full group of students in the online
classroom. We added our own research reflections with our experiences as
facilitators of the real-time international videoconferences and online
writer’s retreat workshops.

**Analysis**: The qualitative data were analyzed using an iterative
process that included immersion in the data; reflecting and stepping
back; analysis by taking apart, selecting, and classifying; synthesizing
and reconfiguring; and relating to other work (see Wellington, 2015).
This analytic process produced three prominent themes, elaborated as
“findings and themes”.

**Results**: This is a very qualitative, extensive description of the
outcomes, so it is impossible to give particular results, however these
sentences extracted from text allow to grasp the main outcomes: -
((EMOTIONS,INTENT)) Rather than thwarting action learning about various
forms of energy transition afforded students a way to shift feelings of
hopelessness about the climate emergency by considering concrete
individual and collective actions on energy transition. - ((AWARENESS))
Building on their existing understandings of the climate emergency, the
concept of energy transition helped students envision alternative
futures. - ((INTENT)) the shift came as students together conceptualized
alternative transitions and concrete changes to fossil fuel use in
diverse contexts – including their own roles in enacting collective
changes toward specific energy systems - ((KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS)) This
vision extended beyond a simplistic vision of “saving the planet” to
consideration of the complexities of justly transforming energy use
within their diverse yet interconnected contexts. Structural change was
inherent to their understanding of energy transition, and students made
connections between their individual lives and broader social structures
within a global system. - ((INTENT)) While students spoke about
individual actions to reduce energy consumption, such as turning off
lights and reducing use of electronics, they also discussed how
individual behaviors were affected by what was expected and normalized
according to each of their sociocultural and infrastructural contexts. -
((EMOTION)) Fear may be understood as an inevitable component of both
personal and systemic change, but such fear, according to the students,
is preferable to the hopeless suspension of a future that has already
been set. - ((AWARENESS, EMOTION)) students were impacted by learning of
the displacement of Indigenous peoples for wind farms in northern
Colombia and for the oil sands in Canada, including how such injustices
around alternative energy sources are not taught in science classes. -
((AWARENESS)) Some students acknowledged the insularity of their own
thinking and home contexts, which motivated them to learn about
different situations from other students. - ((KNOWLEDGE, INTENT))
Through relational learning, students not only understood the
interconnected nature of energy transition, but also formed initial
bonds toward acting on energy transition in the future. - ((KNOWLEDGE,
AWARENESS)) In the IYDEF, students learned how different types of energy
function (e.g., fossil fuels, wind, solar, biomass), how energy
infrastructures afford and limit particular lifestyles, and how
carbon-based expectations of the future might need to shift. -
((KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS)) Students largely recognized the value of
relational learning and they came to a deeper understanding of the
structural causes of energy and climate injustices.

**Improved?**: Knowledge, awareness, intent and emotion improved toward
something more compatible with climate justice and energy transition

## 10.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Energy literacy - Understanding the complexity of
energy transition in its local and global aspects (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - counsciousness of energy transition solutions -
counsciousness of local/global dimensions of energy transition and
climate justice (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: - individual/social willingness to act to reduce climate
injustices and act on energy transition (*Worked?*: Yes )

**emotions**: - Reducing hopelessness - “positive” fear (instead of
negative hopelessness) - empathy toward victims of climate injustices
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**action**: - Communication on climate justice and energy transition
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 10.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Ultimately, the IYDEF enabled expression of a diversity
of youth voices that spoke about the need for solidarity around energy
and climate issues rather than merely technical or political stopgaps.
The IYDEF provides a possible model for how education might be
accountable to young people and their futures in diverse contexts
globally. Rather than simplistically positioning youth as our “hope” for
a just and renewed planet, we learned how we might better prepare them
for uncertain energy futures that require more than simply moving to
alternative energies. Energy transition is not only technical, but also
social and cultural.

**Message to keep:**: What is the most interesting about this paper is
the idea of a global collaborative classroom, allowing the students to
personnaly understand the reality of climate justice and energy
transition. Also, the authors show how this knowledge/awareness has
strong connections with the emotions and intent of the students.

**title** Climate Change and TESOL: Language, Literacies, and the
Creation of Eco-Ethical Consciousness

## 11.1 abstract

This article calls on the field of TESOL to respond to the planet’s
growing climatic and ecological crisis, conceptualizing climate change
beyond just standards-based language and content curriculum. Climate
change is also cultural and religious, and thus warrants broader
consideration in TESOL. Drawing on theories of value creation and
creative coexistence, the author considers climate change
socioculturally, epistemologically, and ontologically toward the
development of a value-creative eco-ethical consciousness. The author
concludes with a critical instrumental case study that used ethnographic
and discourse analytic methods to examine the effects of a
standards-based climate change unit among adolescent religious refugee
English language learners (ELLs) from the former Soviet Union (FSU).
Findings suggest these ELLs’ curricular engagement developed their
language, literacies, and content knowledge relative to climate science.
It also fostered transformed perspectives and value creation toward an
eco-ethical consciousness consonant with their cultural religious
identity expression. Intersecting multiple subareas of TESOL, including
FSU learners, digital literacies, religion and spirituality, and
standards-based approaches, the case study findings have potentially
broader transferability implications beyond climate change and language
learning and instruction.

## 11.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study examined religious adolescent ELLs’ curricular engagement
with climate change to understand how it affects their (1) language
acquisition, knowledge accretion, and literacies development and,
thereby, (2) epistemological and ontological development and religious
(cultural) identity expression.

**Questions**:

## 11.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Video watching, reading, writing, video creation

**Description**: The ESL teacher, Mr. Ross, engaged students in two
types of curricular interaction with climate change: critical
consumption and critical composition of “texts,” which he defined in
multiple forms and genres. Texts for critical consumption included (as
presented) “Climate Change” in Easy English News (Claire, 2007), which
also provided vocabulary and material for content quizzes; the film An
Inconvenient Truth (Guggenheim, 2006); two magazine advertisements
centered on climate change (for Honda and for Diesel clothing); three
online articles about sustainability perspectives and practices of
Evangelicals, Muslims, and Buddhists; product and political commercials;
the video “George Bush on Global Warming—Spoof by Will Ferrell”
(Buzzpal, 2007); and a reading comprehension worksheet on “Spaceship
Earth.” Critical composition involved short writing activities (e.g.,
posing questions about texts, personal narratives) and, as the final
project, composing digital video (DV) political commercials for or
against “being ‘green.’”

## 11.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Data were collected daily for 7 weeks and included multiple
semistructured and audio-recorded interviews with individual
participants, ethnographic fieldnotes from daily classroom visits and
interactions with participants, daily video recordings of classes, and
student work (including digital video projects, quizzes, homework, and
in-class notes and assignments).

**Analysis**: data annotation relative to content and a priori themes -
inductive analysis regargind repeated patterns and emergent themes -
narrative of findind using a color coding and a visual model of
convergent themes. The narrative of findings is framed with
interpretative commentary (for triangulation, credibility,
transferability and dependability) and offers a “holistic cultural
portrait of the social group that incorporates both the views of the
actors in the group (emic) and the researcher’s (etic) interpretation”

**Results**: It is difficult to report results which are very
qualitative, descriptive and extensive, however, here are a few
sentences which help grasp the main outcomes: - Ira and Mikhail
demonstrate appropriation and command of unit vocabulary to articulate
critical print literacy of real and contrived perspectives of global
warming in “green” advertising - Mikhail and Ira expressed their own,
now transformed, beliefs about religion and climate change. - all
students created commercials for being green, all focusing on recycling.
((they had the choice between for and against being green)) - In turn,
they created value from the unit and developed transformed views of
religion and climate change—and articulated a faith-based eco-ethical
consciousness. - Ira and Mikhail, like all observed FSU students,
initially believed global warming was a false “theory” that contradicted
the Bible. However, in the space Mr. Ross provided for them to explore
and discuss religion and climate science curricularly and
sociodialogically, they began to express transformed faith perspectives
toward creative coexistence - In articulating intersections between
their faith and the climate unit, Ira and Mikhail express a consciously
transformed faith perspective toward personal benefit and eco-social
contribution.

**Improved?**: ((AWARENESS)) the students get to associate their
religious beliefs, the science of climate change in a new form of
ethical consciousness ((KNOWLEDGE)) the students developed climate and
english literacies together

## 11.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Climate literacy and language acquisition around
climate/environmental notions (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - beliefs around climate change - resolution of potential
conflict between religious and scientific belief (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 11.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: These ELLs $$English Language Learners$$ demonstrated a
dynamic learning about climate change that included language
acquisition, accretion of knowledge, and literacies consumption and
production. $$...$$ such learning is possible relative to both language
and content standards. Second, findings also suggest these ELLs likewise
developed epistemologically and ontologically, displaying transformed
perspectives and value-creative actions toward climate change resulting
from their learning. In short, they developed an eco-ethical
consciousness

**Message to keep:**: This study focused on 2 learners, and there is not
much detail on the climate change content and change in the learners.
However, the paper is interesting in showing that climate change
literacy may be a part of other types of curricula (here: english as a
foreign language) and the population: religious minorities who have to
deal with contradictory position between their churches and science.

**title** What effective design strategies do rural, underserved
students in STEM clubs value while learning about climate change?

## 12.1 abstract

This study investigated the experiences of rural, underserved middle
school students in afterschool clubs. Culturally relevant climate change
education strategies were used to enhance students’ climate change
literacy. We investigated changes in students’ climate change literacy,
perceptions of strategies used, and what they valued about the clubs by
analyzing a pre-post survey (N = 97) and structured written reflections
(N = 113). A new integrative framework brought together climate change
education design elements to promote culturally relevant programming in
an afterschool setting. The effective climate change education
strategies and Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) guided data analyses.
Overall, students demonstrated significant growth in climate literacy;
beliefs, attitudes, and subjective knowledge did not increase
significantly. Students’ reflections indicated some climate change
strategies resonated more than others. Analyses using EVT found that
students’ interest/enjoyment and identity were most often described,
followed by self-efficacy and expectations for success with club tasks.
Implications for practice are shared.

## 12.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study aims to bridge this gap in the literature to learn more about
the climate literacy of vulnerable youth, whose experiences have been
underrepresented in the literature and who are likely to be
disproportionately and negatively impacted by the changing climate.

**Questions**:

1.  In what ways, if any, did students’ climate literacy change
    following participation in these intentionally-designed STEM Clubs?
2.  In what ways, if any, did students’ post-club reflections indicate
    the salience of the design elements utilized in these STEM Clubs?
    3.In what ways, if any, did students’ post-club reflections indicate
    what they valued about the design elements following attendance of
    these STEM Clubs?

## 12.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Indoor

**Type**: Lessons, hands-on activities, discussions, exchange with
experts

**Description**: 3 sessions of STEM club over 2 months concerning
climate change: - Weather vs. climate - Greenhouse gases and Carbon
footprinting - Alternative energies In each session, there are different
activities classified in general strategies: - Personnaly relevant and
meaningful intervention (e.g. personal articles for club newsletters) -
Using active and engaging teaching methods (e.g. videos, set up carbon
dioxide greenhouse to model warming) - Engaging in deliberative
discussions (e.g. card sort & discussion, station labs) - Interacting
with scientists to experience the scientific process for themselves
(e.g. state climatologist via zoom, guest speaker from WWF, fisheries
PhD students) - uncovering and addressing misconceptions (e.g. national
geographic videos, quizzes in the newsletters) - implementing school or
community projects (e.g. poster in school to reduce impact, newsletters
written and sent every week)

## 12.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: ((Quantitative)) A survey was given both pre- and
post-intervention, administered to individuals online through Qualtrics.
Students took the pre-survey at the beginning of the first climate
change STEM Club and took the post-survey at school during an
enrichment/study hall period within a month following the final climate
change-focused club meeting. Students completed the surveys within 18
min, on average. The survey was developed using items selected from the
Yale Project on Climate Change Communication’s American Teens’ Knowledge
of Climate Change survey (Leiserowitz, Smith, and Marlon 2010, 2011) to
assess objective knowledge, attitudes, and subjective knowledge The
survey was modified to both measure the constructs of interest and to
reduce the number of items, reduce the length of the survey, and
eliminate overly difficult content items. - Objective knowledge: climate
literacy. Objective knowledge was measured via 76 items, grouped to
represent the seven Essential Principles of Climate Science (USGCRP
2009). - Beliefs/attitudes. The survey included 4 items assessing
students’ attitudes about climate change: belief that it is happening,
confidence in that belief, worry, and their understanding of the
scientific consensus. - Subjective knowledge. Students’ subjective
knowledge – how much someone thinks they know about a topic – about
climate principles 2, 6, and 7 was assessed using 5 items
((Qualitative)) Following each club meeting, all students were invited
to complete a three-item reflection questionnaire, in which they
examined their perceptions about collaboration and offered their general
thoughts. A codebook was co-developed to capture samples of how the
students’ responses mapped onto the constructs with approximately 25% of
the sample; then, students’ statements were coded, guided by the
codebook, by the first two authors. After independent coding of the rest
of the data, all codes were reviewed and differences in interpretation
were negotiated until there was 100% agreement

**Analysis**: ((Quantitative)) Survey data were analyzed to evaluate
changes from pre- to post-intervention, using paired t-tests. Cronbach
test are used on every part of the survey, and globally. ((Qualitative))
There is not much information about the analyse, except explanation
about how data was coded and consensus reached (see data collecting)

**Results**: ((Quantitative)) - Objective knowledge: climate literacy
((KNOWLEDGE)) Students’ correct responses increased 5.1% from 36.3% to
41.4% (p \< .01). Results are divided in 7 main topics: 1. The sun is
the primary source of energy for Earth’s climate system. 2. Climate is
regulated by complex interactions among components of the Earth system.
3. Life on Earth depends on, is shaped by, and affects climate. 4.
Climate varies over space and time through both natural and man-made
processes. 5. Our understanding of the climate system is improved
through observations, theoretical studies, and modeling. 6. Human
activities are impacting the climate system. 7. Climate change will have
consequences for the Earth system and human lives. In particular,
students showed statistically-significant growth in their knowledge of
principles 1, 2, and 6. - Beliefs/attitudes ((AWARENESS, EMOTIONS)) No
statistically significant differences were seen pre- to
post-intervention for students’ beliefs/attitudes. Both prior to and
after the intervention most students (87–92%) believed that climate
change was happening. Students reported being somewhat to very confident
that global warming was happening. They were not very to somewhat
worried about climate change. - Subjective knowledge ((AWARENESS))
students considered themselves to be not very well to fairly well
informed about climate change causes, effects, and ways to reduce
climate change. ((Qualitative)) This concerns the valuation of the
pedagogical strategies by the students , which is not directly what we
are interested in: - The students valued working in teams and learning
through rich discussion about climate change. - Additionally, many
students acknowledged how much they valued activities that were
physically engaging. - Overwhelmingly, students expressed their
interest/enjoyment for the climate change meetings (176 unique
instances; 63.7% of students). Students most commonly expressed that
they had fun (‘fun’ was mentioned 115 times) and that they enjoyed the
activities (‘enjoy-’ mentioned 15 times). - Many students reflected on
how the club meetings and their own interactions in the club meetings
aligned with how they identified as a person/student (130 unique
instances; 49.6% of students) - Students also felt as if the content in
the climate change-focused clubs, or STEM Clubs in general, would be
useful to them - The positive aspects of personal and collective
identity in highly social hands-on activities was a more prevalent
aspect described by students, likely increasing most students’ retention
and/or active participation in club activities - In their after-club
reflections, only ten per cent of the adolescents who participated in
the clubs remarked on the relevance of the content to their personal
lives. Some students did remark about how the content was meaningful in
other ways: 15% of the students described how their new content
knowledge would help them to attain a future goal and 8% of the students
claimed that the content was useful to them. - ((INTENT)) students in
the current study reported feeling empowered to make personal changes
within their homes, demonstrating their noticing of the extracurricular
strategy of mattering as they made plans for climate change mitigation
strategies.

**Improved?**: Knowledge and intent improved, concerning emotion,
awareness, no improvement is significant

## 12.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - correctness in climate literacy content survey (see
results for the content tested) (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - Beliefs/attitudes: whether students believe CC is
happening and whether they are confident in that - Subjective knowledge:
whether students considered themselves well informed about CC
(*Worked?*: No )

**intention**: From the quantitative analyses: feeling of empowerment to
make personal changes within their homes in terms of mitigation
strategies $$no precise habits or actions$$ (*Worked?*: Yes )

**emotions**: Worry (a question in the survey) (*Worked?*: No )

**other**: - valuation of the pedagogical strategies (*Worked?*: NA )

## 12.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: First, middle school students, overall, had significant
gains in climate literacy, with most growth focused on the climate
literacy principles: (1) the sun is primary source of energy for Earth’s
climate system, (2) climate is regulated by complex interactions among
components of the Earth system, and (6) human activities areimpacting
the climate system. Second, students’ beliefs, attitudes and subjective
knowledge did not increase significantly, although students’ initial
beliefs about whether climate change was happening were very high, and
students were somewhat to very confident that global warming was
happening. Third, students were most likely to positively describe
climate change strategies in their reflections that were active and
engaging (#2), engaging in deliberative discussions (#3), and uncovering
misconceptions (#5) (Monroe et al. 2019). Fourth, the majority of
students valued the club meetings, expressing interest and enjoyment of
the activities and their use of novel equipment.

**Message to keep:**: What is interesting in this study is that the
authors used 3 bodies of literature to conceive activities toward poor
rural communities in a STEM club: effective climate change education
strategies based on Monroe et al 2019, culturally relevant pedagogical
strategies (Morrison, Robbins, and Rose 2008) and effective strategies
for extracurricular programs (Eccles and Templeton 2002). Even though it
was not effective in terms of awareness and emotions, it showed results
in terms of knowledge and marginally on intent. It is a good example on
how the educators could use the most relevant and modern knowledge to
develop pedagogical strategies. Note: this is a very large study (28p)
with an apparently serious analysis, a lot of the analyses are not
directly on the outcomes we are interested in though (valuation of the
pedagogical strategies by the students)

**title** Place-based inter-generational communication on local climate
improves adolescents’ perceptions and willingness to mitigate climate
change

## 13.1 abstract

With the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged to promote strategies
and policies to substantially reduce their carbon emissions. To align
public sentiment with potentially expensive climate mitigation policy,
climate change education is considered an essential tool in tackling
climate change, particularly for the young generation. However, a
general lack of engagement is driven by the perception that climate
change is irrelevant at local and individual scales. Based on a modified
version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, we implemented a new climate
change educational programme, in 12 rural areas of China, where
adolescents communicated with local seniors (aged aeyen 60 years) in
focus groups to discuss local climate over the past decades. Seniors’
memories of extreme climatic events generally were in concordance with
meteorological data. The adolescents’ uncertainty about climate change
exhibited significant change after the programme, followed by concern,
risk perception, and perceived behavioural control. Based on mediation
analysis, the shift in adolescent concern and perceived behavioural
control translated into greater willingness to support climate change
mitigation. Thus, we suggest that climate change education should
emphasize place-based strategies that highlight the relevance of global
climate change through local impacts and individual experiences
vis-a-vis inter-generational communication to promote greater engagement
with climate change.

## 13.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

We introduced ((and evaluated using the Theory of Planned Behaviour)) a
new educational programme for climate change that included inviting
adolescents to communicate with seniors (aged ≥ 60 years) in focus
groups to discuss the local climate during the past several decades.

**Questions**:

No really questions, but three hypotheses were tested: H1: Climate
change can be observed and perceived by individuals in their own
lifetimes through local extreme weather events; H2: The perceptions
about climate change will improve in adolescents who communicate with
local seniors; H3: The place-based inter-generational communication on
local climate can contribute to the changes in behavioural intention of
mitigation.

## 13.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular, but I have a doubt: “, we
introduced a new educational programme for climate change that included
inviting adolescents to communicate with seniors”

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lesson, intergenerational exchange/discussion

**Description**: 1. a 30-min lecture introducing global climate change
(lecture group + communication group) The lecture was based on heuristic
approaches and included questions, images and video clips. 2. 30-min
communication between adolescents and local seniors on local climate in
focus groups. (communication group) We used a focus group setting for
inter-generational communication in order to avoid skewed individual
biased recall and capture the richness of perceived local information.

## 13.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: The survey ((pre-post)) included questions related to the
modified model of the TPB ((Theory of Planned Behaviour)), measuring a
range of perceptions associated with climate change, related behavioural
intentions, and key demographic variables 15 min in-depth interviews
were conducted on two students from each focus group ((complete
treatment group)), who had higher expressing abilities that could
provided comprehensive explanations beyond “yes” or “no” response as
purposive sampling after the post-tests

**Analysis**: ANOVA for testing intervention groups and control on each
construct, with Tukey HSD post-hoc test, type III sum of square -
multiple mixed linear model regression mitigation intention vs
lecture/communication groups, site as random factor (1: all the
socio-demographic variable, 2: all the changes in perceptual variables,
3: 1+2) - multiple mediation analysis with bias correction bootstrap
((some kind of path analysis based on the Theory of Planned
Behaviour)) - thematic content analyses of the post interviews

**Results**: ANOVA AND Mixed linear model\_ - Controlling site as a
random factor, the communication group showed a considerable reduction
in uncertainty, an increase in concern and risk perception regarding
climate change compared with the lecture group. The communication group
also showed a significant increase in perceived behavioural control,
subjective norm, place attachment, and mitigation intention. -The
results of the mixed linear model showed that the changes in concern
could be used to positively predict the changes in intention in model 3
(Table 1). The changes in perceived behavioural control, subjective
norms, and place attachment were also strong predictors of changes in
intention. However, although uncertainty and risk perception improved
significantly after the communication, both failed to explain the
changes in intention. - Demographic variables other than gender were not
significant predictors of intention changes. - Communication experience
also failed to show a significant direct relationship with changes in
intention ((but the Tukey post test show a significant difference
Qualitative - The results of the in-depth interview (N = 72) generally
supported the quantitative analysis. - Increased risk perception was
most frequently mentioned (94.4 %) Result not directly related to our
objectives: - The descriptions of trends and extreme climatic events
from local seniors were generally consistent with local meteorological
data

**Improved?**: All constructs (uncertainty, concern, risk perception,
subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, place attachment and
mitigation intention) showed the highest positive effects from the
“communication” (lecture + intergenerational learning), effect of the
lecture only were generally higher than in the control group, and lower
than the complete intervention. NOTE: the mixed model with site as
random factor does not show a significant effect of the intervention
group on intention, which makes the authors have contradictory
conclusions about it, however the Tukey post test show it, and the
multiple mediation analysis shows also indirect effects through the
theoretical construct

## 13.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Risk perception of local vulnerability to climate
change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - Uncertainty about climate change reality (*Worked?*:
Yes )

**intention**: - Behavioural intention of climate change mitigation
(*Worked?*: Yes/Unclear )

**emotions**: - Place attachment to natural aspects - Concern about
climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: In the Theory of Planned Behaviour, 2 construct are used to
explain the Intentions (subjective norms, the surrounding social
pressure about the intention, and perception of control, the perception
about our capacity to act efficiently). In this study, they are declined
as: - Subjective norm - Perceived behaviour control (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 13.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “This study showed that place-based strategies for
climate change education have considerable potential to render the
abstract concrete for helping adolescents understand global issues.
Emphasizing experience-based interpretation and showing the rele- vance
of global climate change to local impacts and individual experiences by
inter- generational communication makes the invisible process of climate
change visible for engage- ment.”

**Message to keep:**: In China the focus groups with local seniors to
discuss local climate change have a positive effects on all the
constructs (perception) of the Theory of Planned Behaviour toward
mitigation intentions, which in turn is, according to this theory, the
best predictor for behavioural change. This outperform the only lecture
intervention, which is for most of the construct better than the control
group (no intervention). 3 specificities might be worth noting: - the
use of the Theory of Planned Behaviour gives a different but complete
cognitive/attitude vision of CCE - a result may not be directly relevant
to us but important: local senior evaluate well the local climate change
effects, the “non-expert” discussions in intergenerational learning may
be used for CCE! - the mixed model with site as random factor does not
show a significant effect of the intervention group on intention, which
makes the authors have contradictory conclusions about it, however the
Tukey post test show it, and the multiple mediation analysis shows also
indirect effects through the theoretical construct

**title** Designs for learning about climate change as a complex system

## 14.1 abstract

This paper reports on a study in which students used agent-based
computer models to learn about complex systems ideas of relevance to
understanding climate change. The experimental condition used a
Productive Failure (PF) learning design in which ninth grade students
initially worked with agent-based computer models to solve challenge
problems followed by teacher instruction about targeted climate and
complexity ideas. In contrast, the comparison condition employed a
Direct Instruction (DI) learning design in which the teacher instruction
was provided initially, followed by the students working on the same
computer models and challenge problems as the experimental group. The
students in the PF group scored significantly higher on the post-test on
measures of climate and complex systems explanatory knowledge and near
and far knowledge transfer. Theoretical and practical implications of
these findings are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

## 14.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

We conducted a study that contrasted and compared the efficacy of a PF
((Productive Failure)) design versus a DI ((Direct Instruction)) design
to help students deeply learnconceptual knowledge about climate ideas
and complex systems.

**Questions**:

RQ1: Are PF and DI treatment conditions equally effective for students
to learn declarative and explanatory knowledge1 about climate and
complex systems ideas? RQ2: Are PF and DI treatment conditions equally
effective for fostering the ability to use the targeted climate and
complexity knowledge for solving two classes of new, not previously
studied, problems? The first class is near transfer, which is solving
new problems in the same domain (e.g., climate problems or complex
systems problems), and the second class is far transfer, which is
solving new problems in a different domain

## 14.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons, computer assisted modeling

**Description**: 6 days: - Pre test - Feedback in dynamic systems.
Climate: global temperature, greenhouse effect, cloud cover. Complex
systems: modeling of the ant foraging model - Emergence. Climate: Wind
and storm model. Complex systems: Birds flocking model - Dynamic
equilibrium. Climate: Carbon cycle model. Complex systems: Wolf-sheep
predation model - Tipping points and positive feedback. Climate: climate
model with water feedback. Complex systems: forest fire model - Post
test For every pedagogical activities, the class correspond to a teacher
lecture (15-20 min), an example of complex system model (15-20 min), and
a climate and complex systems models (10-20 min) In the Productive
Failure treatment, the lecture takes place after complex system modeling
activities, in the Direct Instruction treatment, before the modeling
activity.

## 14.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Qualitative open-ended questions concerning four aspects of
climate and complex system knowledge in a pre-post survey: - declarative
knowledge (simple knowledge about concepts of the climate system) -
explanatory knowledge (explaining climate processes) - near transfer
problem (concerning climate system) - far transfer problem (concerning
complex system in another domain) The answers were coded on a 1-4 scale
describing correctness of knowledge and reasoning, and used in
quantitative analyses

**Analysis**: The students’ performance was assessed with a marking
rubric that consisted of a four-point coding scheme. - two-ways
ANOVA/ANCOVA with follow-up t-test (treatment group + experience of
teachers vs declarative knowledge/explanatory knowledge/near
transfer/far transfer) - qulitative analysis of class observations

**Results**: declarative knowledge scores for the two treatment groups
were statistically equivalent in terms of their respective knowledge
gains from pre- test to post-test and there were no significant teacher
effects. (F(1,105) 1⁄4 1.652, p \> 0.1, h2 p 1⁄4 0.015) - For climate
explanatory knowledge, a two-way ANOVA revealed that there was a
significant main effect of treatment group and a significant main effect
of teacher experience at post-test favored the high experience
teachers. - For complex systems explanatory knowledge, a two-way ANCOVA
found that there was a significant main effect for the experimental
treatment group (F(1,105) 1⁄4 21.126, p \< 0.001, h2 p 1⁄4 0.167): while
the students in each of the groups scored higher with experienced
teachers compared to early career teachers, the PF group scored higher
overall than the DI group. - being in the PF treatment had a significant
positive impact on the near transfer scores compared to the DI
treatment. - being in the experimental PF group and having an
experienced teacher each respectively had a positive influence on far
transfer knowledge test scores, but that there was not a statistically
significant special benefit of having both.

**Improved?**: All aspects (declarative knowledge, explanatory
knowledge), resolution of near transfer and far transfer problems
increased in the 2 pedagogical treatment (there are distincts effect of
the teacher experience and the pedagogical treatments)

## 14.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - correctness in declarative knowledge concerning climate
system (e.g. relating biosphere to carbon cycle) - correctness in
explanatory knowledge concerning climate system (e.g. behaviour of
climate phenomena) - ability to use the complex system ideas to resolve
a near transfer problem concerning the complex climate system (butterfly
effect) (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: - ability to resolve a far transfer problem, using complex
system notions in a different domain (not climate) (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 14.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The Productive Failure pedagogical design (presenting a
problem to the students before the lecture) did not do better than the
Direct Instruction (lecture first) design in terms of declarative
knowledge (simple conceptual knowledge about the climate system), but it
performed better in terms of explanatory knowledge (explaining processes
in the climate system), near transfer problem (concerning the climate
system) resolution and far transfer (in another domain) problems. The
authors note that there are 2 explanations: - social perspective: PF
treatment caused more engagement and more collaboration between students
and with the teachers (more questions) - cognitive perspective: the
lecture after the problem allows to activate cognitive processes of
knowledge assembly and shema abstraction

**Message to keep:**: A very interesting study which shows that
different pedagogical designs with exactly the same activities but a
different perspective (problem resolving before lecture) may have
important effect on the capacity of students to use complex system
concepts to better understand the climate. What is also interesting is
that the author show that this may have effect particularly in the
capacity of understanding complex problem even beyond the only domain of
climate.

Purpose: Climate change education and the emotional consequences this
topic raises in the classroom has been largely ignored by researchers.
This paper considers the emotional response to climate education in a
primary classroom (age 9-10 years) in England and begins to explore the
emotions that teaching about climate change may raise for both teacher,
researcher and pupil. Design: Part of a long-term ethnographic project
in a school in England. Analysis of c60, 9-10-year olds drawings,
participant observation notes and research diaries. Limitations: This is
a small study-further research with larger numbers, different ages and
in different geographical regions are required with both pupils and
teachers. Practical implications: This work identifies pedagogies that
allow injustices children identify to be explored with emotional
responses being navigated rather than ignored. Such approaches support
wellbeing in the face of growing numbers of young people suffering from
eco-anxiety. © 2021, sowi-online e.V.. All rights reserved.

## 15.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This paper considers the emotional response to climate education in a
primary classroom (age 9-10 years) in England and begins to explore the
emotions that teaching about climate change may raise for both teacher,
researcher and pupil.

**Questions**:

1.What are the emotional responses 9-10-year olds recognize with regard
climate change and climate education? (2.How does an ethnographic
approach add to our understanding of emotions when teaching climate
education?) ((Not extracted

## 15.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons, drawings and expression of emotions

**Description**: (The intervention is complex to describe because it is
embedded in a long-term teaching/classroom ethnography project) - before
the described session: “Previous to the lesson about climate change we
had worked with the class on issues that related to this theme, for
example fast fashion which, as an industry, contributes 10% of global
carbon emissions.” and lesson about climate change - described session:
“a session that direcly asked pupils about their feelings regarding
climate change”, where students are the “experts on their own knowledge”
organized as discussions and questions to the children, accompanied with
activities of drawing, and expression of their emotions, in 3 parts: 1.
WHat is climate change and the climate crisis (with drawings) 2. Causes
of the climate change (with help of a “scale” to express feelings) 3.
Solutions :“who or what is going to help us” (with drawings)

## 15.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: “Classroom ethnography”. Qualitative analysis of: - drawing
from the children - discussion around the drawing (the teacher walk
through the class and provoke discussion and explanation on the
drawing - expression of emotion helped by a “scale” where all the
student are expected to place their feelings - research diaries from the
teachers where they write their impressions

**Analysis**: “Classroom ethnography”. Qualitative analysis of: -
drawing from the children - discussion around the drawing (the teacher
walk through the class and provoke discussion and explanation on the
drawing - expression of emotion helped by a “scale” where all the
student are expected to place their feelings - research diaries from the
teachers where they write their impressions

**Results**: Overall results: the children who took part in the planned
climate education lessons experienced a spectrum of emotion. Activity 1
and 2 ((general knowledge and cause of the climate change)) saw many
usually considered negative emotions being displayed and talked about by
young people - such as anger, sadness and helplessness. Activity three
((future and solutions)), saw more positive feelings in the class with
all participants being able to identify ways in which we might mitigate
the consequences of climate change. Children were more hopeful and
happier. On activity 2, the authors also noted a large and shared anger
of the students toward the adults which the students considered as
responsible of climate change

**Improved?**: Overall results: the children who took part in the
planned climate education lessons experienced a spectrum of emotion.
Activity 1 and 2 ((general knowledge and cause of the climate change))
saw many usually considered negative emotions being displayed and talked
about by young people - such as anger, sadness and helplessness.
Activity three ((future and solutions)), saw more positive feelings in
the class with all participants being able to identify ways in which we
might mitigate the consequences of climate change. Children were more
hopeful and happier. On activity 2, the authors also noted a large and
shared anger of the students toward the adults which the students
considered as responsible of climate change

## 15.6 Outcomes

**emotions**: Emotions expressed by the students in activities
concerning: 1. the general knowledge 2. the cause of climate change 3.
the solutions (*Worked?*: Yes, but what do we consider as “working”? )

## 15.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: general knowledge and causes of climate change cause
negative emotions: anger, sadness and helplessness in young student
lessons on solutions cause positive emotion such as hope and happiness

**Message to keep:**: This article is very specific in its methodology
(classroom ethnography) and objectives (emotional responses to climate
change education) in young students (9-10 years). The authors describe
negative emotion to the general knowledge and cause of climate change
and positive one on the topic of solutions for climate change in the
future.

**title** Enhancing Primary School Students’ Knowledge about Global
Warming and Environmental Attitude Using Climate Change Activities

## 16.1 abstract

Climate change generally and global warming specifically have become a
common feature of the daily news. Due to widespread recognition of the
adverse consequences of climate change on human lives, concerted
societal effort has been taken to address it (e.g. by means of the
science curriculum). This study was designed to test the effect that
child-centred, 5E learning cycle-based climate change activities would
have over more traditional teacher-centred activities on Malaysian Year
5 primary students (11 years). A quasi-experimental design involving a
treatment (n = 55) and a group representing typical teaching method (n =
60) was used to measure the effectiveness of these activities on (a)
increasing children’s knowledge about global warming; (b) changing their
attitudes to be more favourable towards the environment and (c) identify
the relationship between knowledge and attitude that exist in this
study. Statistically significant differences in favour of the treatment
group were detected for both knowledge and environmental attitudes.
Non-significant relationship was identified between knowledge and
attitude in this study. Interviews with randomly selected students from
treatment and comparison groups further underscore these findings.
Implications are discussed.

## 16.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study was designed in the context of primary school education in
Malaysia with the underlying purpose of selecting teaching models that
promote students’ knowledge related to global warming and attitudes
towards the environment

**Questions**:

3 hypotheses: (a) Specially designed student-centred, 5E learning
cycle-based climate change activities increases climate change knowledge
of the students compared to the traditional teacher-centred approach.
(b) Specially designed, 5E learning cycle-based student-centred climate
change activities increases pro-environmental attitudes of the students
compared to the traditional teacher-centred approach. (c) There is a
significant positive relationship between pro-environmental attitudes of
the students from treatment group with their knowledge about climate
change based on the post-test results.

## 16.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons, experiences, simulation game

**Description**: Five weeks activities: (a) investigating the effect of
greenhouse gases, (b) the carbon dioxide role play, (c) modelling the
melting of icebergs, (d) modelling the melting of glaciers and (e)
investigation of renewable and non-renewable energy that students use in
their homes. In the control treatment the same topics are presented in
teacher-centered lectures

## 16.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: ((KNOWLEDGE)) pre-post questionnaires on global warming
adapted from a study in the UK (Taber & Taylor, 2009) - ((AWARENESS))
attitude toward the environment measured with a questionnaire NEP for
children - ((KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS, INTENTION)): further insights of
student knowledge and attitudes were obtained through 30 minutes
semi-structured interviews on 10 students ((5 in each group))

**Analysis**: ANCOVA approach was used (Shadish et al., 2002) where the
pretest comparison within-group variance based on pre-experiment
differences To control experiment-wise error rates (i.e. error rates for
the study as a whole), Bonferroni adjustments were used to test each
hypothesis at the corresponding aadj 1⁄4 aexp/3 levels Qualitative
analyses are conducted but there is no described methodological
framework

**Results**: Quantitative: - The first hypothesis stated that there
would be no significant difference in understanding about global warming
between treatment and comparison treatment groups as measured by global
warming test. This hypothesis was (as presented in Table 2) rejected
(F(1, 112) 1⁄4 193.6, p , .00033). The treatment group (M exp 1⁄4 17.07,
SD exp 1⁄4 2.54) outperformed the comparison group (Mcont 1⁄4 9.50,
SDcont 1⁄4 2.75), suggesting that they were more knowledgeable about
global warming. - The second hypothesis stated that there would be no
significant difference between treatment and comparison groups in the
attitude towards the environment as measured by the NEP Scale for
Children. This hypothesis (as presented in Table 2) was rejected (F(1,
112) 1⁄4 7.52, p , .0167). The treatment group exhibited more
pro-environmental attitudes (Mexp 1⁄4 35.27, SDexp 1⁄4 4.66) than the
comparison group (Mcont 1⁄4 32.9, SDcont 1⁄4 4.29) - The third
hypothesis states that there would be no significant correlation between
pro-environmental attitude and knowledge about global warming of the
treatment group students based on the post-test results. This null
hypothesis was not rejected at the chosen a-levels (r(53) 1⁄4 0.285; p
1⁄4 .035) suggesting that there was no significant correlation between
understanding about global warming and pro-environmental attitude.
Qualitative: - ((Contrary to students in the control group)) The
students in the treatment group provided brief, but specific and
knowledgeable responses. When asked about the causes for global warming,
the treatment students showed that two weeks after the unit, they made
appropriate connections - Consistent with the quantitative results,
students in the treatment group expressed more pro-environmental
attitudes. Compared to the students from the comparison group, the
interview responses reflected somewhat more positive attitudes together
with self-reported changes in pro-environmental behaviours

**Improved?**: The treatment group ((constructivist 5E method)) had
better results in term of knowledge of climate change, attitude
((AWARENESS)) toward environment and attitude ((INTENTION)) regarding
energy use

## 16.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness in a knowledge based test on global warming
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Attitude toward environment from the NEP scale for
children (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: “Attitudes toward the environment” measured in pre-post
qualitative interviews $$question such as the willingness to turn off
electrical devices after use$$ (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 16.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The 5E pedagogical method (constructivist) is more
efficient for students to gain knowledge, and change attitudes
$$AWARENESS, INTENTION$$ than the classical teacher-centered lessons.
However, no clear correlation between knowledge and attitudes is found
when the results from all the students is mixed

**Message to keep:**: In this study, traditional teacher-centered
lessons are compared to 5E constructivist methods based on students
activities, and the latter seem to have a clearly more efficient effect
on knowledge, awareness and intentions of the students. It might be
worth noting that the researchers insist on the fact that in the
malaysian education, it goes opposite to the traditional exam-focused
education. Moreover there was no overall (without considering treatment)
correlation between knowledge and attitudes.

**title** Experiential-based climate change education: fostering
students’ knowledge and motivation towards the environment

## 17.1 abstract

Climate change is one of the most important environmental issues
affecting our society today and we need to educate the citizens about
the impact on human lives. An attempt was made to integrate
experiential-based climate change education into the teaching and
learning of secondary school Biology lessons on the topic of Endangered
Ecosystem to improve students’ knowledge on climate change and increase
motivation towards caring for the environment. Two classes from a school
were randomly assigned to experimental (N = 30) and control groups (N =
32). Following the intervention, a one-way analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) with pre-test data as covariate showed statistically
significant differences in knowledge and motivation. Experiential-based
climate change activities enabled students to construct the knowledge
socially and also satisfied the three basic human needs: competence,
autonomy and relatedness, which have subsequently promoted motivation.
The findings described in this study are similar with other studies
which reported that constructivist-based experiential learning has
successfully developed awareness and encouraged learning and critical
thinking about climate change. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as

## 17.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study attempts to integrate experiential-based climate change
activities into the teaching and learning of Form Four Biology lessons
on “Endangered Ecosystems.” The effectiveness of this intervention to
improve students’ knowledge on climate change and their motivation was
measured

**Questions**:

NA

## 17.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lessons, Field trip, discussions, videos, Carbon footprint
calculation, role game discussion.

**Description**: Experimental treatment, during each activity students
go through 4 stages of learning: concrete experience; reflective
observation; abstract con- ceptualization; and active experimentation. -
first week: field trip to Penang National Park, observation, photos,
comparison with close city Georgetown) - second lesson: video about
climate change and discussion, analysis of global climate change data -
third lesson: interactive presentation regarding greenhouse effect,
experiments with plastic bottles (temperature) - fourth lesson: climate
change in local and global community, climate change card game, lessons
on climate change effect - fifth lesson: carbon footprint calculation -
sixth lesson: role playing (minister, architect, teacher, doctor,
student, farmer, businessman, environmentalist, town planner and
policeman) Each group had to discuss and present how they could reduce
the impact of climate change globally and locally. Control treatment: In
the control group, the students were taught about climate change and how
climate change endangered our ecosystem as presented in the Form Four
Biology curriculum specifications (CDC, 2006), using their Ministry of
Education certified textbooks. During the lessons, the teacher used the
chalk and talk method to teach the entire topic on climate change.

## 17.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Climate Change Knowledge Test (CCKT): The CCKT, Shepardson,
Niyogi, Choi, and Charusombat (2009), was used to measure students’
knowledge about climate change. The test consisted of five items: four
open-response items and one-draw-and-explain item that tested the
students’ knowledge related to climate change. Motivation Toward the
Environment Scale (MTES) The MTES obtained from Pelletier et al. (1998)
was used to measure students’ motivation towards environment. The MTES
consisted of 24 items with six subscales: intrinsic motivation,
integrated regulation, identified regulation, introjected regulation,
external regulation, and amotivation. Each subscale consisted of four
items.

**Analysis**: The scores obtained from pre-test and post-test were
analyzed using one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) Data collected
from this study were analyzed and the level of significance was set at
0.05 (p\< 0.05) similar to other studies on climate change

**Results**: Knowledge: - both groups exhibited an increase in the
minimum and maximum scores. However, it is observed that the increase in
the experimental group was higher than the control group. The mean
post-test score of the experimental group was also higher than the
average (Mexp = 9.66; SD exp = 1.66). - there was a significant effect
(F(1,59) = 88.30, p \< 0.05) of experiential-based climate change
education on the students’ knowledge about climate change after
controlling the pre-test scores. The partial eta-squared value of 0.599
indicates that 59.9% of changes in the post-test were caused by the
treatment. Motivation toward the environment: - In the post-test from
the results in Table 5, it is clear that the students in the
experimental group exhibited higher mean values for the first three
motivations: intrinsic, integrated and identified compared to the
control group. For th the experimental group displayed higher increase
than the control group students did. This suggests that the treatment
received by the experimental group students resulted in the students
having more pro-environmental motivation than the control group students
do.e other three subscales, introjected, external and amotivation, both
groups exhibited lower mean scores. This shows that they improved on
these three subscales. -

**Improved?**: Both groups have increased their knowledge and moved
toward intrinsic motivation toward the environment. However the increase
is greater for the experimental group (experiential based with
constructivist bases).

## 17.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness in the Climate Change Knowledge Test
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**emotions**: Measurement of motivation Toward the environment scale.
The scale measure whether the motivation is
intrinsic\>integrated\>identified\>introjected\>external\>amotivation.
The idea is that people having more self motivation is more likely to
act than people having an extrinsic motivation (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 17.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Experiential based constructivist pedagogy is more
efficient for knowledge gain and creating a more intrisic motivation
toward the environment.

**Message to keep:**: An experimental study with an experimental and a
control group which shows that the experiential based contructivist
method is more efficient for knowledge gains and to create a more
intrinsic/personal motivation toward environment. This more intrinsic
motivation is expected to be more likely to push toward action. The
authors insist on the special role of the local field trip in the
experimental group which makes students more “touched” by the local
ecosystem and the consequences of climate change

**title** Changing Climate Change Education. Exploring moderate
constructivist and transdisciplinary approaches through the
research-education co-operation k.i.d.Z.21

## 18.1 abstract

The COP21 Agreement 2015 sets very high targets, which cannot be reached
by political agreements or technological progress alone. Within this
context, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), and particularly
Climate Change Education (CCE), play an ever increasing role regarding a
holistic societal transformation towards a sustainable world. Creating
ESD/CCE learning settings and delivering scientific evidence for their
success has turned into a vital challenge in order to meet the high
expectations. In this longitudinal study, based on the research project
k.i.d.Z.21 - Competent into the Future, we deliver scientific evidence
of the success of CCE when based on transdisciplinary and/or moderate
constructivist theories, and show that the impact is even higher when
both approaches are combined. The data presented derive from scientific
surveys and tests, involving 343 teenagers before and after intensive
collaboration with a high number of experts, including renowned climate
change scientists.

## 18.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study aims to provide scientifically reproducible evidence of the
comparable success of the various educational modules of k.i.d.Z.21,
when delivered in three ways: in line with moderate constructivist
theories, in line with transdisciplinary theories, and, thirdly,
delivered via a combination of both theories.

**Questions**:

- does the project k.i.d.Z.21 raise the young participants’ preparedness
  for CC and its consequences?
- Do they find that moderate constructivist theory and transdisciplinary
  theory when practised in CCE settings play vital roles in enhancing
  their deeper understanding of CC and its consequences?
- Is there an even greater impact on the participants’ learning
  experience by combining both moderate constructivist and
  transdisciplinary approaches?
- Are the teenagers able to produce detailed responses regarding their
  CCE experiences?

## 18.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular and extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Lessons,Seminaries,Research projects,Field trip

**Description**: k.i.d.Z.21 is a one-year multi-module programme, the
interventions analysed here are: - classical school lessons on CC -
every student’s two individual CC research projects - lectures,
workshop + debates with CC experts - CC research students + CC experts
in high Alpine settings (one-week excursion)

## 18.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-post questionnaire - teacher online survey - structured
interviews with the head teachers - pencil and paper survey completed by
students

**Analysis**: Quantitative: - T-Test for dependent samples on self
reported gain in preparedness - Anova with Games-Howel post-hoc test on
Likert scale data - Nominal data analysed with chi-square tests
Qualitative: - follows a deductive approach on a theoretically
depveloped set of categories reliability of the pre-post tests with
Holsti and randomly adjusted coefficient of Krippendorff’s alpha

**Results**: General result: raise in preparedness for CC and its
consequences ((KNOWLEDGE)) - students rated themselves: pre- 51%, post-
75%, significative chi-squared test - t-test show also a significative
increase on the same data Comparing educative approach: - all of the
innovative approach es are rated to convey a much better understanding
than classical school lessons (ANOVA, p\<0.001; post-hoc tests, all p
values\<0.001) - the module classical school lessons on CC is given the
highest rating 1 by only five percent of participating students, whereas
both the modules lectures, workshops + debates with CC experts (19
percent), and every student’s two individual CC research projects (21
percent) are rated approximately four times higher. - Combining
transdisciplinary and moderate constructivist approaches, the module CC
research students + CC experts in high Alpine setting shows the most
profound influence on CC understanding (33 percent) compared to the
other modules (Chi square test, p\< 0.001)

- classical school lessons take two thirds of the project time per
  student per year (66.6 percent,100 h/150 h), but they are awarded less
  than three percent of the overall positive codings affirming learning
  by the students.
- two thirds of the codings affirming learning appear to be achieved in
  little more than ten percent of the project time in a combined
  transdisciplinary and moderate constructivist approach.

**Improved?**: Self-reported knowledge increased and students identified
the approaches combining moderate constructivist and transdisciplinary
approaches as the most helpful for this raise.

## 18.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Self reported preparedness for CC and its
consequences - how each module helped understand CC and its consequences
(self-reported) (*Worked?*: Yes in the follow up but back at baseline in
)

## 18.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: - Overall the k.i.d.Z.21 have a very positive effect on
the self-reported preparedness $$KNOWLEDGE$$ for CC and its
consequences - both innovative approach (moderate constructivism and
transdisciplinary approaches) are reported as more useful than
traditional school lessons - Combining moderate constructivism and
transdisciplinary approaches is the most useful reported approach

**Message to keep:**: This is another k.i.d.Z.21 study which show great
results in raising (self-reported) knowledge of the students. When
modules are compared, the ones following innovative pedagogical approach
(moderate constrictivism or transdisciplinary approach are perceived as
performing better, and combining them show even greater results.

**title** International Peer Collaboration to Learn about Global Climate
Changes

## 19.1 abstract

Climate change is not local; it is global. This means that many
environmental issues related to climate change are not geographically
limited and hence concern humans in more than one location. There is a
growing body of research indicating that today’s increased climate
change is caused by human activities and our modern lifestyle.
Consequently, climate change awareness and attention from the entire
world’s population needs to be a global priority and we need to work
collaboratively to attain a sustainable future. A powerful tool in this
process is to develop an understanding of climate change through
education. Recognizing this, climate change has been included in many
science curricula as a part of science education in schools. However,
teaching such a complex and global topic as climate change is not easy.
The research in this paper has been driven by this challenge. In this
paper, we will present our online science module called Global Climate
Exchange, designed with inquiry activities for international peer
collaboration to teach climate change. In this study, we engaged 157
students from four countries (Canada, China, Sweden, and Norway) to
collaborate in Global Climate Exchange. To explore the opportunities
that international peer collaboration in Global Climate Exchange gives,
we have analyzed how students develop their explanations about climate
change issues over time. Our analysis showed that the students increased
the proportion of relevant scientific concepts in relation to the total
number of words in their explanations and that they improved the quality
of links between concepts over a six-week period. The analysis also
revealed that the students explained more perspectives relating to
climate change issues over time. The outcomes indicate that
international peer collaboration, if successfully supported, can be an
effective approach to climate change education. © 2015 by iSER,

## 19.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To explore the opportunities that international peer collaboration in
Global Climate Exchange gives ((internet platform, base of the
intervention)), we have analyzed how students develop their explanations
about climate change issues over time

**Questions**:

- How do students develop their explanations about climate change issues
  over time when participating in Global Climate Exchange?
- Is the development of the students’ explanations of climate change
  issues correlated to how the students interact with their peers?

## 19.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular ((supported by teachers, it might even
be part of the study plan, but that is not clear in the paper

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Wiki redaction, discussions on internet

**Description**: “We have developed a science module ((on an internet
platform)) called Global Climate Exchange. In Global Climate Exchange,
students collaborate with their peers from other countries ((here:
Norway (only ones analysed), China, Sweden, Canada)) in online
inquiry-based activities. The module was designed as a scaffolding wiki,
in other words, as an online knowledge community where students were
scaffolded through activities, by tasks given by the designers and the
teachers, to explore and discuss climate change issues. In Global
Climate Exchange, students were guided to collaborate with their peers
through four different activities: Brainstorm activity, Issue activity,
Discussion activity, and Chat activity, during a 6-week period -
Brainstorm activity: During the first week, the students worked on the
brainstorm activity, where they identified national climate change
issues, added these to a Google Map developed specifically for this
activity, and described the issues on a brainstorm page. Through this
activity, the students started to communicate national and local climate
change issues to their peers. After finishing this activity, the
students’ work was examined by teachers and researchers to identify
global issues that were relevant for further elaboration in the
subsequent activities - Issue activity : After the brainstorm activity,
each student was assigned to one of the twelve climate change issues,
building groups containing students from different countries. The
students’ task was, in collaboration, to investigate and describe their
climate change issue further; more specifically, they were asked to
describe the issue, give relevant examples from their own countries, and
explain the science related to the issue. - Discussion activity: Still
working in their groups from the issue activity, the students were
introduced to a discussion activity. The discussions were initiated by
questions posed by the designers and teachers about climate change
topics:”What is ‘Global’ in Global Climate Change?“,”How can changes in
your lifestyle improve climate change?“,”What could be done?“,”What has
been done?“, and”What might happen if we do nothing?” - Chat activity:
Embedded in Global Climate Exchange there was also the option for
students to, at any time, create a chat room. There was no guidance
provided for the use of chat rooms in Global Climate Exchange, except
for some ethical rules, which were monitored by researchers and teachers
in each country.

## 19.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Using the usernames of the students, the author extracted all
the content from the wiki platforms and analysed them (see analyses for
the identification and coding of categories), they also extracted
(number indicators) the activity and interactions of the students in the
platform.

**Analysis**: There is no real complex analyses used, however, the
identification and coding of the qualitative data is very structured:
“The analyses were conducted in following three steps. In the first
step, scientific concepts, links, and perspectives in students’ written
explanations were identified and coded. Secondly, after students’
explanations were categorized into concepts and links, they were
converted into concept maps. This coding included an organization of the
explanations in terms of how coherent the explanations were and the
relevance of different parts fitting the explanation as a whole. In this
step, explanations of cause and effect relationships were evaluated. The
categorizations of explanations are based on the taxonomy of Causal
Models and the SOLO taxonomy. To answer the second research question,
the developments of students’ explanations of climate change issues were
correlated with how the students interacted with peer students’ online
activities.

**Results**: Use of concepts: The results show that the proportion of
relevant scientific concepts in relation to the total number of words
used in the explanation increased on average from 0.16 in the first week
to 0.20 in the last week. The proportion of concepts that the students
used in their explanations varied from 0.12 to 0.36 between students,
whereas there was less variation within each student’s explanation over
time. The greatest difference was between the students’ use of concepts
in the first week (SD = 0.13), which declined to 0.8 in week 2, and then
to 0.6 from week 3 to week 6. - Link quality between concepts: The first
week had links in students’ explanations that were dominated by low
quality: weak/irrelevant/misunderstood. The proportion of low quality
links decreased in the third week and remained stable until week 6. -
Variety of perspectives on the studied issues: Six perspectives were
identified in the students’ initial explanations: cause, evidence,
mechanism, predicted consequence, remediation, and adaptation. In the
first week, students focused mostly on explaining predicted consequences
(37%). In week 6, the students focused similarly on predicted
consequences (29%), evidence (27%), and mechanisms (23%). The number of
perspectives explained increased until week 3, and then became stable
until week 6. On average, the students explained three perspectives in
week 6, but it varied from one to four. - Quality of causal patterns: In
the sixth week, a large majority of the students’ explanations were
categorized as Medium (n = 11) or Medium–high (n = 5). Compared to the
first week, this is an increase of 41%. It is also worth noting that
none of the students’ explanations was at Medium–high in the first week,
whereas almost a third were in this category by week 6. These students
developed their explanations in terms of describing multiple causes and
effects, and by describing how these causal relationships were a part of
the whole system. More than half of the students (n = 11) ended up
having a medium quality to their explanations of climate change issues,
meaning that they identified multiple linear causalities involving
multiple indirect connections, used a variety of concepts, and linked
them properly together as valuable examples or complementary
information, and they described at least three perspectives for climate
change issues. Second question: is the quality of student explanations
linked to the peer interactions in the platform: - Twelve of 19 students
developed their explanations in terms of advancement; for example, they
better explained causalities using scientific concepts, by linking
concepts together, and explaining their perspectives regarding climate
change issues. These students interacted with their peers three times
more often on average compared to those who did not advance.

**Improved?**: All knowledge aspects improved over time, students used
more scientific concepts in their explanations, better quality of links
between concepts, with more variety in the perspectives and an overall
improved quality of the causal pattens

## 19.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: During their explanations in the wiki on climate
change: - Use of scientific concepts - Links between concepts - Use of
variety of perspectives - Quality of causal patterns (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 19.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The intervention (use of an internet platform where
students, chat, participate to discussions and create a wiki on climate
change) successfully improved the use of concepts by the students, the
relations between these concepts, and the quality of the scientific
explanations that the student gave. “The results of this study indicate
that international peer collaboration, if successfully supported, can be
an effective approach to climate change education.”

**Message to keep:**: The intervention (use of an internet platform
where students, chat, participate to discussions and create a wiki on
climate change) successfully improved the use of concepts by the
students, the relations between these concepts, and the quality of the
scientific explanations that the student gave. It is worth noting that
the activity articulated in a very smart way the local and global
climate change issues: the students from 4 countries (Norway, China,
Sweden and Canada even though only Norwegian students were analyses)
were put into groups on thematic and could develop local issues with
their peers from other countries. The interaction between those peers
seem to have a beneficial effects in the improvement of knowledge even
though there are some methodological uncertainties.

**title** Exploring local environmental change through filmmaking: the
Lentes en Cambio Climatico program

## 20.1 abstract

How can youth become leaders in their communities’ resilience efforts?
The Lentes en Cambio Climatico (LECC) filmmaking program aimed to
empower students to investigate how a changing climate affects their
lives and use their own findings to inspire local resilience. Secondary
students in LECC created films that explore the experiences of community
members and document local knowledge around climate topics relevant to
their lives. A mixed-methods study measured the program impacts on
students. Results from summer implementations in 2018 and 2019 suggest
that participation in LECC increased students’ awareness, confidence,
and engagement around climate topics and their interest in contributing
to community resilience efforts. Additionally, by leading community
discussions during film screening events, students gained confidence in
their leadership roles, and ability to share their expertise with
parents and community members. These conversations appeared to both
empower students and amplify their voices as advocates for change in
their communities. Supplemental data for this article is available
online at <https://doi.org/10.1080/00958964.2021.1949570> .

## 20.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Explore the extent to which producing films on local climate topics: a)
impacts students’ awareness of and perspectives on climate change, b)
increases students’ awareness of climate change’s causes and effects
and, c) transforms how students think, communicate about, and/or engage
in efforts to help mitigate local climate challenges.

**Questions**:

NA

## 20.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Audiovisual creation

**Description**: LECC workshops consisted of seven-days of informal
science learning. In these workshops, students learned about climate
change and filmmaking techniques before engaging with other students to
create their own films. The LECC workshops were divided into three
phases of filmmaking: pre-production (research and scripting),
production (filming), and post-production (editing)

## 20.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre and post workshop surveys (Awareness, 2018 and 2019) -
Transformative Experience questionnaire (Awareness, intention) -
post-workshop focus groups (2018) - individual student interviews
Interviews and post workshop interviews were transcribed and translated,
then coded by the researchers

**Analysis**: Pre- and Post- survey (likert scale) were analysed using
Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests Focus groups and interviews were coded and
analysed qualitatively using thematic analyses (Braun & Clarke,2006)

**Results**: Awareness: - better results in the surveys
(e.g. significance increase in their confidence on their knowledge on 4
aspects of climate change, p\<0.5 with medium or large effect size) -
interviews: 5 of 11 respondents (45.5%) mentioned an increaded awareness
of local climate change issue - focus groups: increased awareness around
the topic on which they made their films Intention: - from interviews
and focus groups: eight out of 12 (66%) mentioned the need or desire to
take actions, whether that was changing their own actions, feeling more
motivated or wanting to educate others Knowledge: - “While the study did
not aim at researching students’ knowledge gains around climate change,
we studied the self-report data on how well-informed the students felt
around climate change topics before and after their participation in the
program. Our data show significant increases with medium to large effect
sizes for students’ confidence in their understanding of climate
topics.” - note that the knowledge gains found through the qualitative
analyse of interviews and focus groups show that the knowledge comes
primarily from and on the topics that the students made their films on

**Improved?**: The LECC program had a measurable impact on students’
awareness and engagement around climate topics, and students described
feeling more agency to enact changes in the community that address
climate change. The data show as well significant increases with medium
to large effect sizes for students’ confidence in their understanding of
climate topics ((particularly in local topics related to the specific
topics of the films that each student made)). Finally, many students
expressed the need or desire to take action, whether that was changing
their own actions, feeling more motivated to do something, or wanting to
educate others.

## 20.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Knowledge about local concrete effect of climate change
in Puerto Rico (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: 1. increased students awareness of climate changes causes
and effects 2. Recognition of its impact on their lives 3. awareness of
solutions to prevent or mitigate environmental challenges (*Worked?*:
Yes )

**intention**: Need or desire to do something through either personal or
group action (coded “action” by the researchers) (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 20.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The film production by the students improved their
awareness and intentions, particularly concerning the local topic of
their film

**Message to keep:**: The main message we should keep is that Art (film
production) activities may have a very positive effect on awareness and
intentions (knowledge is less important here). A side message, not
extracted in our variables is that the activities “empowered” the
students and made them agent of change in their communities. Interesting
paper because climate change education can have synergistic effects :
more people interested in science, bring more fun, etc.

**title** Ocean literacy gamified: A systematic evaluation of the effect
of game elements on students’ learning experience

## 21.1 abstract

Low levels of concern about anthropogenic climate change have been
attributed to a range of factors, some of which relate to education.
These include people’s lack of understanding and engagement with the
multifaceted nature and extent of the problem that it presents to
current and future generations. Limited knowledge is also known to be an
obstacle to individual behaviour change, with important implications for
young people’s perceptions of the urgency to act and awareness of the
consequences of their own behaviours. In this study, we explored ways to
address low levels of understanding about ocean science dimensions to
climate change phenomena, cognisant of a growing awareness that formal
education curricula do not adequately engage young people with
developing ocean literacy. Participants were a sample of secondary
school students (11 to 14 years) in Portugal and the UK. Using a
gamified mobile application, it was examined relationships between the
use of different game elements such as points, badges and leaderboards,
and learning outcomes. Systematic evaluation of each element shows how
different game features affected the participants’ learning experience
and learning outcomes. Implications for formal and informal marine
education, climate education, and how to improve ocean literacy efforts,
are also discussed.

## 21.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

this study was conducted to understand if there is any relationship
between different game elements, such as points, badges, leaderboards
(also known as the PBL triad), and learning outcomes of ocean literacy.

**Questions**:

can different game elements impact the learning outcomes and, if so,
how?

## 21.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Portugal: extracurricular UK: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Game application, lesson

**Description**: All student: 15 min class presentation on topics:
eutrophication, ocean plastic, sea level rise 4 groups of students with
differently designed game: - 1: game with points element - 2: game with
badge element - 3: game with leaderboard element -4: game with points,
badge, leaderboard elements (PBL triad) 1 control group (class
presentation but no game)

## 21.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Same questionnaire (correct/not correct/Don’t know) in all
treatments.

**Analysis**: Comparison of the correctedness of answers in the
treatments (game elements) and country with the control group (no game,
in both countries) with a model I factorial (orthogonal) ANOVA. Post-hoc
comparison of treatments with Dunnett test

**Results**: The application improve the acquisition of knowledge, the
game elements have a positive effect, which is lower when they enhance
too much the competition between students

**Improved?**: Overall results: the Ocean literacy mobile application
improve the acquisition of knowledge, compared to the oral explanation
only group. Concerning the element of the games: the results are
consistent in the 2 countries, the leaderboard element cause
competitions between students which may have a negative effect on the
acquisition of knowledge, but the other treatments (points, badges and
PBL triad: all elements) have a positive effects

## 21.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctedness of answers concerning ocean literacy
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 21.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: The application improve the acquisition of knowledge,
the game elements have a positive effect, which is lower when they
enhance too much the competition between students

**Message to keep:**: Interesting use of games in addition to formal
lessons on ocean literacy. Overally the application (game) improve the
knowledge acquisition, and the gamification elements are more efficient
when they do not enhance too much the competition (over collaboration)
between students

**title** Adventure learning as a curricular approach that transcends
geographies and connects people to place

## 22.1 abstract

Effectively communicating scientific research has taken on greater
importance as climate change impacts the world we live in. It is
increasingly incumbent upon the science and education communities to
produce and deliver curriculum that is timely, accessible, and
scientifically accurate. In the summer of 2012, scientists and educators
worked together to develop and conduct the Adventure Learning @
Greenland (<AL@GL>) project, which explored the capacity of hands-on and
web-based climate science education experiences that occurred in
Greenland and the US. The Adventure Learning approach and associated
framework was used to design the learning experience during <AL@GL>
activities. Participating students were from Greenland, Denmark, and the
US; these students included participants who were diverse, rural, and
traditionally underrepresented. Participating students worked closely
with educators and scientists to learn about an atmospheric observatory
at Summit Station, located on the Greenland Ice Sheet. The purpose of
this article is to inform readers in how they may use Adventure Learning
and the newly developed curriculum model called Content, Transition,
Inquiry, and Synthesis for the education and outreach of research
projects. © 2015 British Educational Research Association.

## 22.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

((Note: this is not presented as the main objective of the paper, but:))
The two knowledge gaps most closely related to <AL@GL> that will be
explored in this article are: (1) understanding AL through smaller scale
expeditions and limiting the content scope of AL and (2) research into
’the nature of the relationship between learners and experts

**Questions**:

NA

## 22.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: NA

**Description**: NA

## 22.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: The survey was developed specifically for the <AL@GL> project
and included questions modified from the Student Understanding of
Science and Scientific Inquiry survey (Liang et al., 2008), and the New
Ecological Paradigm survey (Dunlap, Van Liere, Mertig, & Jones, 2000),
along with content-specific questions (e.g. What is a cloud?). The
survey instrument was a compilation of existing, validated instruments
and content-specific questions that aligned with the ICECAPS project.
Instruments were chosen and developed based on the anticipated outcomes
of the <AL@GL> programme. Although the survey was not piloted for this
study, the validation of the survey instruments used serves as a
reasonable assurance for results of the non-content questions.
Pre-surveys were administered to students in Greenland and the US prior
to <AL@GL> activities. Post-surveys were administered immediately
following <AL@GL> activities and prior to students departing for home.

**Analysis**: Two-tailed t-test on the total score of the students
comparing pre and post test. Otherwise the results are merely a
representation of the test results in 2 graphics and a table
(percentage)

**Results**: The assessment showed mixed results. Total scores across
the multiple choice items relating to understanding of science inquiry,
the nature of sci ence, and perceptions of human ecological impact
remained essentially unchanged for students in Greenland and the US
after participating in the programme. However, short-answer responses
indicated that students’ understanding of key topics that were the focus
of the programme. Percent correct scores on the post-test were more
variable, but had a higher median ; scores increased for eight of the
students with data on both measures, and remained roughly the same for
the remaining 14 students. Overall, percentages were higher for students
in Greenland than for students in the US. This could be because students
in Greenland were more directly involved with ICECAPS ((Scientific
project in the polar station)) instrumentation and could more easily
make the connection to proxy learning tools. The results were not found
to be statistically significant. However, the lack of statistical
significance was likely influenced by the small sample size and a
corresponding lack of statistical power. The increases in understanding
shown in Table 2 are encouraging.

**Improved?**: Unclear

## 22.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: content knowledge, understanding science inquiry and the
nature of science and perception of human ecological impact
concerning: - Clouds - Radiation - Greenhouse effect - Weather and
climate (*Worked?*: Unclear )

## 22.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: <AL@GL> \[Adventure Learning @Greenland\] represents a
fruitful avenue for education and outreach associated with scientific
research that leverages technology for the benefit of learning and the
promotion of climate science literacy.

**Message to keep:**: The “adventure learning” framework and the
international collaboration between students and with scientist in a far
station of greemland are very appealing. The ideas around the
organization of the curriculum (Content, Transition, Inquiry, Synthesis)
are interesting as well, however, the very small sample size and the
lack of significative improvement of the students makes it difficult to
draw conclusions

**title** The Integration of Environmental Pollution Materials in Social
Studies Learning in School for Anticipation of Climate Change

## 23.1 abstract

Social studies learning is expected to integrate environmental
education, in accordance with the objectives of social studies learning
to improve students’ thinking skills, social problem solving skills and
care for the environment In fact, social studies teachers were found to
have not utilized the physical or social environment as a source of
learning, despite various environmental pollutions have often occurred
in Indonesia and resulted in global warming as an indication of climate
change. This research was intended to 1) identify materials of
environmental pollution around students as a source of social studies
learning; 2) integrate environmental pollution materials in social
studies learning to anticipate climate change; 3) determine the
effectiveness of learning activities on the integration of environmental
pollution materials to anticipate climate change. This research was
classified as quantitative and qualitative research (Mix Method). Data
were collected by means of interviews, observations, documentations and
questionnaires. The results of the research showed that 1) materials of
environmental pollution around students as a source of social studies
learning consisted of water and air pollution that have an impact on
global warming, thus resulting in climate change; 2) environmental
pollution materials were integrated into social studies learning by
reviewing core competencies and basic competencies as outlined in the
lesson plan (RPP) and student worksheets (LKS) with a score of 83%
(valid); 3) Learning activities on environmental pollution materials had
been running more effectively, because of the integration of pollution
cases in the surrounding environment to anticipate climate change. This
was indicated by the significant difference in the results of the
pretest and posttest tests of 0.025 © 2022, Pegem Egitim ve Ogretim

## 23.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: lessons and activities

**Description**: Activities: taking care of plants, sorting waste,
composting, recycling and saving energy in school The lessons are based
on the research and presentation of local environmental issues

## 23.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test / post-test, Cronbach alpha analysis on
questionnaire, t-test

**Analysis**: pre- post questionnaire on environmental awareness are
compared with t-test

**Results**: Significative t-test on the mean results of pre-test
post-test on the environmental awareness questionnaire (mean pre: 113
points, post-test:125 points) Increase for 11 participant, decrease for
4. M

**Improved?**: Better scores in the environmental awareness
questionnaires

## 23.6 Outcomes

**awareness**: Student’s environmental awareness (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: There might be more than just awareness since the authors
have a discourse about relationships between knowledge, awareness and
actions (p. 56) but the questionnaire is not available. Authors note
that the students are more enthusiastic, because the issues presented
are related to local lives of participants (local environmental issues)
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 23.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “Utilization of the surrounding environment as a
learning resource is able to facilitate students to connect theit
experience with new information” “School may be utilized as a supporting
facility in carrying out environmental education through knowledge,
awareness and attitudes, as well as rational and respondible behavior
towards environmental problems”

**Message to keep:**: The use of local environmental issues as a way to
teach climate change in the context of social studies is something the
authors insisted a lot on.

**title** The Impact of Project Activities on the Cultivation of
Ecological Citizenship in a High School Climate Change Club

## 24.1 abstract

This research explored the characteristics of students’ activities and
their artifacts during their participation in climate change club
projects and investigated the impacts of the club project participation
on students’ ecological citizenship. Climate change club projects were
developed to help students understand climate change, investigate
climate change issues, and plan and participate in social actions.
Participants developed scientific models of causes of climate change and
were expected to develop the own perspectives about socio-scientific
issues related to climate change. Five types of competences of
ecological citizenship were targeted through club activities: knowledge
and understanding, responsibility, justice, sustainability, and
participation. Researchers found activities were student centered and
interactive and artifacts generated by students were resources for
social action. Climate change club activities demonstrated the potential
for student participation in club projects to promote competence for
mitigating climate change among future generations by fostering a new
form of citizenship: ecological citizenship.

## 24.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

1.  What are the characteristics of students’ activities and artifacts
    during climate change club projects?
2.  How do the project activities in a high school climate change club
    affect the cultivation of students’ ecological citizenship?

**Questions**:

NA

## 24.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Club activities consisting in lessons, researches, activities
such as communicating in school and managing waste policies in school

**Description**: Step 1: understanding climate change (2 weeks) -
lessons on climate change - organizing groups of students and
discussions - construction of a model (with drawings) explaining cause
of climate change Step 2: investigating the climate change issues (2
weeks) - investigating ((local and in dayly lives)) climate change
issues - presentation and discussions of issues from each group Step 3:
planning and participating in social practice (3 weeks) - develop social
practice plan to fight climate change - implementation of practice and
evaluation of activities

## 24.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Pre- post- questionnaire for ecological citizenship, students
artifact from their activities, field notes and in-depth interviews were
collected. However, it seems that pre- post- questionnaire were mostly
used to prepare the interview which were then analysed.

**Analysis**: Qualitative analyses, note that participant are informed
of the interpretation of their interviews and confirm its
interpretation, an effort is done for triangulation

**Results**: The analyses are qualitative and presented as examples and
overall impression from the researchers, hence difficult to present
here. The authors seem confident that the awareness has improved in
terms of “responsability”, “justice” (global social justice associated
with CC). Concerning knowledge they also say that the students have a
better knowledge of causes and consequences of CC Concerning intention,
while the results seem globally positive they are somewhat contrasted

**Improved?**: Knowledge and awareness improved (concerning knowledge
that is said by the researchers but no clear example are given).
Concerning intention, the results seem to be more contrasted but the
researchers seem to be positive in terms of “sustainability competence
of ecological citizenship”.

## 24.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Understanding causes, impact and characteristics of
climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - responsability: consciousness about the anthropogenic
cause of CC and its consequences for “living and non-living things that
share our ecosystem” - justice: consciousness of the link between global
social justice and CC (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: - Sustainability: changing individual behavior/going from
awareness to pratice/reflexion on usual personal behavior -
Participation: willingness to participate (*Worked?*: Yes/Unclear )

## 24.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: No clear conclusion

**Message to keep:**: An example of student club which raise awareness
of the students, no real surprises or original results. One thing to
keep from it might be that in such high achievement school from Asia,
extracurricular club might be a solution to raise awareness since the
official curricula are not very focused in CC, and the expectation for
results from student do not leave much space for such initiative. Also,
the idea of ecological citizenship and the associated “competences” is
somewhat original

**title** Quality Child–Parent Relationships and Their Impact on
Intergenerational Learning and Multiplier Effects in Climate Change
Education. Are We Bridging the Knowledge–Action Gap?

## 25.1 abstract

The science-education cooperative venture “Our Common Future:
‘eKidZ’-Teach Your Parents Well” explores intergenerational learning
processes and the transfer of learning from the younger to the older
generation. Students acting as multipliers and their multiplication
effect on parents is part of the research setting: 20 high school
students, in the role of researchers, investigated the question of
whether children who participate in the Climate Change Education (CCE)
program “k.i.d.Z.21” passed on their climate-change-related knowledge,
attitudes and actions to their parents (n= 91), in comparison to a
control group (n= 87). Due to the annual increase in student
participants in the CCE project “k.i.d.Z.21” since 2012 (n= 2000), this
article can build on the results of a questionnaire regarding the school
year 2017/18 (n= 100-120). A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
showed that the “k.i.d.Z.21” project has a multi-faceted knock-on effect
on parents, constituting a multiplier effect: increasing knowledge, and,
above all, improvements to the child-parent relationship. Additionally,
measurable positive effects in the frequency and quality of climate
change communication between children and their parents have been
observed (Spearman Rank Correlations), but a distinct lack of positive
effects regarding changing climate-friendly attitudes or actions have
been noted (Pearson Product-Moment Correlation). The importance of the
child-parent relationship is a key factor in bridging the
knowledge-action gap, and is reviewed in the context of CCE.

## 25.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

this paper aims to investigate the findings and results of students’
research regarding intergenerational learning processes and multiplier
effects from the younger to the older generation.

**Questions**:

NA

## 25.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: ((The idea is to compare parents with children
participating to the k.id.z21 CCE program to those with children one
year younger, so difficult to know whether is is curricular or
extracurricular))

**Indoor/Outdoor**: NA ((The idea is to compare parents with children
participating to the k.id.z21 CCE program to those with children one
year younger, so difficult to know whether is is presential, I guess it
is?))

**Type**: Children participating in k.i.d.Z.21 CCE project teach, effect
measured on parents

**Description**: We do not have much information on the actual
pedagogical intervention. However the study compare effects on parents
whose children participate on the k.i.d.Z.21 CCE program to those whose
children are one year too young to participate. The k.i.d.Z.21 programme
seems to consist in “annual seminars, research weeks and questionnaire”

## 25.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Questionnaire from which are extracted the factors
“knowledge”, “attitudes”, “action - mobility”, “action - consumption”
and “child parent relationship”. The factor are described but the method
to extract them is not explicited

**Analysis**: After extracting factors “knowledge”, “atttitudes”,
“actions (Mobility)”, “actions (Consumption)” and “child-parent
relationship” from the questionnaire, the statistical procedure MANOVA
was applied to all five factors as dependent variables and the group
experimental/control as independent variable. Direct and interaction
effects were tested. Correlations between factors were also tested.

**Results**: ((KNOWLEDGE)) the knowledge of the parents of the 8th grade
students ((participating)) has increase above the knowledge of the
parents of the 7th grade student ((not participating)) - ((INTENTION))
(called attitudes) the attitudes of the parents have not changed either
over time nor by the “k.i.d.Z.21” project. - ((HABIT)) (called actions)
in both cases the actions of the parents have not changed either over
time nor by the “k.i.d.Z.21” project. Extra results: the relationship
((concerning communication on CC)) between the children of the 8th grade
and their parents has increased beyond the relationship between the
children of 7th grade and their parents. There is a correlation between
knowledge and attitudes ((intention)) (not attributable to the
programme, general) and another between knowledge of the parent and
child-parent relationship. Therefore, the effect might be not conclusive
for the project, but there is a possibility of bridging the
knowledge-action gap by intergenerational learning, and a “multiplier
effects” as a result from teaching CC to the children.

**Improved?**: Knowledge of the parents with chidren participating in
the programme has improved, but not intentions nor habits

## 25.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Factor “knowledge” extracted from questions concerning
auto-report of knowledge confidence, and objective questions on cause
and consequences of climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: Factor called “attitudes” by the authors: “mainly consist
of the willingness to behave in a climate-friendly manner. (*Worked?*:
No )

**habit**: Factor called “action” by the authors, divided into mobility
and consumption. It is a mutifaceted factor, coming from various habits.
(*Worked?*: No )

## 25.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Parents mainly gain knowledge $$not attitudes/actions$$
from their children in climate-change-related discussions, whereby the
quality of the child–parent relationship positively influences the
success of intergenerational learning effects. “The correlation between
increasing knowledge and child parent relationship seems to be a
fruitful way to contribute in the research of bridging the
knowledge-action gap.”

**Message to keep:**: Intergenerational learning where children
participating in CCE teach to parents have a clear effect on the
knowledge of the parents, but not in their intention or habits. The
authors show however that the multiplier effect associated with CCE to
children might be useful to bridge the knowledge-action gap, even though
the effect is not as simple as imagined. “The correlation between
increasing knowledge and child parent relationship seems to be a
fruitful way to contribute in the research of bridging the
knowledge-action gap.”

**title** Potential of ‘future workshop’ method for educating
adolescents about climate change mitigation and adaptation: a case from
Freistadt, Upper Austria

## 26.1 abstract

Using the ‘future workshop’ (FW) method, adolescents can be prepared for
responding to climate-related risks at the local level. The
‘KLAR!–Zukunftswerkstatt’ presents a case study combining climate change
information, FW and place-attachment theories. Its development and
application with 41 learners in one upper-secondary school in Austria
are demonstrated. Statistically significant findings suggest that
students are more aware about mitigation and adaptation behaviors after
participating in FW. Qualitative findings demonstrate that students
developed higher levels of action knowledge for mitigation and
adaptation behaviors. Such teaching approach is not limited to the
researched case, but supports environmental education in general. © 2020

## 26.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

- Examining whether such educational intervention ((Future workshop))
  could raise upper-secondary school students’ levels of awareness of
  mitigation and adaptation
- Examining the effect of ‘KLAR! – Zukunftswerkstatt’ on upper-secondary
  school students’ action knowledge for climate change mitigation and
  adaptation behaviors?

**Questions**:

NA

## 26.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Worshop consisting of lessons, investigation, and proposal
from the students

**Description**: Based on the “future workshop” method, the intervention
consisted in a student centered activity in which students worked in
small groups structured on 5 phase: - preparation phase (50 min):
researchers developed learning content about climate-related risks in
Muehlviertel region and established common rules for collaboration
between researchers and students. - Critique phase (200 min): students
were invited to investigate current and projected climate-related risks
in regional human and natural systems using material from the Austrian
Assessment Report Climate Change 2014 (APCC, 2014) and other sources. -
Fantasy phase (200 min): students developed their own ideas, a theorized
future in which carbon emissions are reduced and adaptation to
climate-related risks is enhanced - Implementation phase (200 min):
participants identified meaningful climate solutions for their home
region and they discussed their personal roles for increased climate
action - Follow-up phase(200 min): final sham event in which students
presented their outcomes to their school and community

## 26.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Questionnaire with quantitative (likert, awareness) and
qualitative questions (free text, knowledge and intention)

**Analysis**: One-tailed wilcoxon signed rank test on awareness (likert)
questions, effect size are also calculated (Cohen r) - qualitative
content analysis on questions where students had to redact test

**Results**: ((AWARENESS)): Signicative (p\<0.001) differences (pre vs
post) with large effect size for awareness on importance of mitigation
strategies, Signicative (p\<0.01) differences with medium effect size on
the importance of adaptation strategies ((Action-knowledge (KNOWLEDGE +
INTENTION))) : More mitigation strategies cited in post test in the
qualitative content analysis. More adaptation strategies cited in the
post-test in the qualitative content analysis. Note: here as well, when
compared, students seem to have more difficulties integrating adaptation
strategies than mitigation ones

**Improved?**: Awareness about importance of local mitigation/adaptation
strategies improved Action-knowledge (knowledge + intention) about the
implementation and specific strategies improved

## 26.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Knowledge about specific strategies for mitigation and
adaptation (e.g. transport, diet, consumption) (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: How important is that people of the region contribute to
mitigation and adaptation? (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: “Action-knowledge” and personal/comunity role in local
mitigation and adaptation (*Worked?*: Unclear )

## 26.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “Future workshop” methodology raised awareness and
action-knowledge about local mitigation and adaptation strategies, and
should be used for other environmental issues. “Educators are
specifically encouraged to frame climate change as a cultural challenge
instead of a purely scientific or technocratic one.”

**Message to keep:**: Future workshop, with place-based research and
proposal of the students raised awareness and action-knowledge about
local mitigation and adaptation strategies. Authors insist on the fact
that mitigation is easier for the students to integrate than adaptation.
Framing climate change as a cultural challenge instead of a purely
technical one is encouraged

**title** Concept Maps in the Classroom: A New Approach to Reveal
Students’ Conceptual Change

## 27.1 abstract

When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various
conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools
to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often
prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed
to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students’
concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude
qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the
approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions
before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For
the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied.
A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From
strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we
assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely
time-consuming handling, the authors’ approach is suitable for
application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to
inform teachers about students’ conceptions.

## 27.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Our study objective was not only (a) to reveal students’ conceptions on
climate change and to monitor conceptual change due to an environmental
education program but also (b) to provide teachers and educators with an
easily applicable approach to analyze the maps and thus, to get to know
their students’ preconceptions.

**Questions**:

Testing the 2 following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1 (H1): The frequency of
students’ alternative conceptions exhibited in concept maps may decrease
after participation in an environmental education program on climate
change. H2: Qualitative changes in conceptions exhibited in concept maps
can be revealed by simple analysis of quantitative parameters (number of
alternative concepts and number of propositions using these concepts),
thus allowing an analysis of conceptions and conceptual change in an
easily applicable way suitable for everyday school life.

## 27.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: lessons, group work, lab experiments

**Description**: A 2-day educational program on global climate change
was designed to fit in the existing curriculum for 10th- grade students,
including comprehensive ecological knowledge and environmental topics in
biology and global (climate) change in geography. It consisted of
student-centered learning units focusing on an individual learning at
workstations, group work and inquiry-based labexperiments. While the
first part of the program was conducted in the classroom, the second,
more practical part,took place in an ecological-botanical garden. Apart
from imparting knowledge about causes, mechanisms, andimpacts of climate
change, the program units were designed to provide students with ways in
which they could contribute to climate mitigation.

## 27.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Concept mapping of the students, pre-post, made by groups of
2-3 students (same groups pre-post) For students to complete their
concept map, we provided them with five concepts referring to some of
the most common alternative conceptions, as well as 20 concepts
essential to explain the scientific view of global climate change. Each
student group was provided with a blank sheet of paper and a list of the
25 predefined concepts in order to portray global climate change, its
causes, mechanisms, and impacts. Students were given 45 min to com plete
the task.

**Analysis**: Analyses were conducted (a) by counting the number of
alternative concepts included in the maps (maximum of five) and (b) the
number of propositions that used these concepts in pre- and postmaps
(quantitative analyses). Also, (c) the propositions were analyzed for
consistency with the common alternative conceptions (qualitative
analysis). For our qualitative analysis, a reference concept map
summarizes the alternative concepts described in the other studies we
reviewed previously. Based on this reference map, we decided whether a
proposition on a students’ map matched the alternative conception or
not. If matching, the proposition was scored 1, if not 0. For every map,
a sum score of alternative conceptions was formed. ((We calculated))
interrater reliabilities (Rye & Rubba, 2002) as well as intrarater
reliabilities, which we calculated by using Cohen’s kappa (Cohen, 1960).
The scoring ranged from .76 to .87 (Table 2), which is regarded as
substantial to almost perfect (Wolf, 1997). Our first hypothesis was
tested by using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare sum scores for
(a) alternative concepts used, (b) propositions using these concepts,
and (c) alternative conceptions of pre- and postmaps. Effect sizes were
calculated applying Pearson’s correlation coefficient r. To test the
second hypothesis, we correlated the differences from pre- to postmaps
for the three parameters. Because the data set was quite small, we
decided for Kendall’s tau to calculate the correlations.

**Results**: The three parameters analyzed (use of alternative concepts,
propositions using these concepts, and student conceptions) showed
significant decreases from pre- to post-maps in the treatment group
(whereas no effects were found in the control group). ((Our qualitative
analysis)) revealed a significant decrease in propositions that match
the common alternative conceptions ((As compared to student’s own
alternative conceptions Correlations showed alternative concepts and
propositions as strongly related to each other.

**Improved?**: The use of alternative concepts, propositions using these
concepts, and student misconceptions decreased after intervention in the
conceptual maps of the students

## 27.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Decrease of the use alternative conceptions in conceptual
maps (misconceptions) (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 27.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Compared to the control group, students of the
treatment group might have integrated the knowledge they achieved during
our educational program into their individually existing knowledge
structures: consequently, concep tual change has occurred, at least for
the time period we analyzed.

**Message to keep:**: In this study, the authors use pre-post conceptual
maps drawn by the high-school students and observe a decrease of common
misconceptions concerning climate change. They show a conceptual change
on a very short time horizon of change

**title** Framing climate change communication to prompt individual and
collective action among adolescents from agricultural communities

## 28.1 abstract

Climate communication research suggests strategic message framing may
help build public consensus on climate change causes, risks and
solutions. However, few have investigated how framing applies to
adolescents. Similarly, little research has focused on agricultural
audiences, who are among the most vulnerable to and least accepting of
climate change. Among 950 high school agriculture students in North
Carolina, we found agriculture and environment framing of climate
change, but not community and health frames, elicited feelings of worry,
and these together with community frames elicited hope. Further,
students feeling more worry were more supportive of individual and
collective action. Those accepting climate change and females had more
emotive responses and higher support for all action measures, and
acceptance of human causes predicted more worry and support for
collective action. We find these results encouraging as agriculture
teachers likely employ agriculture and environment frames when following
best teaching practices.

## 28.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

This study begins to address the need to examine how message framing may
affect emotional responses to climate change and subsequent individual
and collective action among adolescents with a case study of
agricultural students in North Carolina.

**Questions**:

NA

## 28.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: ((The intervention is just the presentation to
students of an article with different framings (agriculture, health
etc), it is done in a school, but I am not sure the
curricular/extracurricular makes sense in this case. If anything I would
tend to extracurricular because it is not in the regular activity
programme of the students))

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Reading one article

**Description**: students were randomly presented with a climate news
story presented in one of four frames: agriculture, community, health,
and environment

## 28.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: One questionnaire: - we asked respondents about the degree to
which they agreed that climate change is (1) happening and (2) human
caused - students were asked to respond to the degree to which the
article ((randomly assigned framing (agriculture, community, health, and
environment))) made them feel worried or hopeful. - students were asked
to respond to questions about support for adaptation and mitigation
measures - We measured intentions to participate in individual actions
with items addressing information seeking, individual energy saving
behaviours, and transportation choices

**Analysis**: ANOVA for testing for differences in emotional responses
(i.e. hope and worry) associated with the different frames. Posthoc
Tukey test - Path model analysis to test for a model including effect of
the framing on worry and hope and then predicted support for adaptation,
support for mitigation, intended individual behavior. Variables
controlled for: gender, belief that global warming is happening, belief
that it is human caused, and political affiliation (Republican,
Democrat, Unaffiliated or Independent)

**Results**: on average, students felt intermediate levels of hope (2.42
out of 5, SD = 1.08) and worry (mean = 2.63/5, SD = 1.27) - Framing was
related to changes in hopefulness (df = 3, F = 6.2, p \< 0.001), but not
changes in worry (df = 3, F = 2.35, p = 0.071) or either measure of
collective action (adaptation: df = 3, F = 0.50, p = 0.681; mitigation:
df = 3, F = 0.70, p = 0.555) Path analysis: - We identified a mediating
relationship where agricultural or environmental framing predicted the
emotion of worry, which in turn predicted intended individual behaviour
and support for collective action - We found no difference in
hopefulness between those students who read the environment or community
frames compared with those who read the agriculture frames - We also
found partial support for our hypothesis that students who felt more
worry and hope after reading the climate change news article would be
more likely to report intended individual behaviour and support for
collective action Uncontrolled variable: - Females were more worried and
hopeful than males, as well as more likely to support adaptation and
mitigation measures and report intended individual climate-friendly
actions - the more likely students were to report that they thought
global warming was happening, the more likely they were to report
feelings of worry and hope, as well as support for adaptation, mit
igation, and individual climate-friendly behaviours - Republicans were
less likely than Independents or those politically unaffiliated students
to support mitigation actions. - We found that those accepting of human
causes had similar responses to framing as reflected in the overall
summary statistics, with environment and community frames associated
with a more hopeful response than health frames (Figure 3). However,
among those sceptical of human causes, the agriculture frame was
associated with greater levels of hopefulness than environment and
health frames (Figure 3).

**Improved?**: Framing was related to change in hopefulness but not in
changes in worry. These analyses can’t really be analysed in terms of
“improved or not”.

## 28.6 Outcomes

**intention**: - support for adaptation and mitigation measures -
intentions to participate in individual actions with items addressing
information seeking, individual energy saving behaviours, and
transportation choices (*Worked?*: NA )

**emotions**: degree to which the article made the students feel worried
or hopeful (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 28.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Agricultural students seem to respond most strongly to
environment and agricultural frames, however the results are somewhat
constrained by external variables such as gender and political views.

**Message to keep:**: The intervention in this paper is very simple:
agriculture students read a paper on Climate change with various
framings (agriculture, community, health, and environment). When the
framing is about agriculture/environment, it has a greater effect on
students emotions (hopefulness). However this is mediated by other
factors such as gender and political views (belief around anthropogenic
climate change). Extra result which might be worth noting: -
understanding human causes of climate change had no relationship with
individual behaviour (encouraging according to authors)

**title** How does epistemological knowledge on modelling influence
students’ engagement in the issue of climate change?

## 29.1 abstract

Involvement in climate change has been proven to be hindered by
emotional and social barriers, as well as by conceptual difficulties
that students may encounter in dealing with scientific content related
to particular issues such as the greenhouse effect. In this study, we
start from the conjecture that behind many conceptual difficulties and
emotional barriers lie particular epistemological obstacles related to a
naive and stereotypical view of science. These include, in particular,
the belief that science still has the role and power to provide a
unique, unquestionable, and certain explanation of events and processes.
Such a naive idea clashes strongly with the intrinsic complexity of
climate science. This paper sets out to investigate if and how the
improvement of epistemological knowledge can influence behavioural
habits and foster students’ engagement in climate change. In order to
explore such an issue, we focus on five interviews collected at the end
of a teaching experience on climate change, carried out with secondary
school students (grade 11; 16-year olds). This study is a follow-up of
other two analytical studies aimed at investigating, respectively, the
impact of the experience on students’ epistemological knowledge and on
their behavioural habits.

## 29.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

NA

**Questions**:

- Did the improvement of epistemological knowledge influence students’
  behavioural and social attitudes and their personal involvement in
  climate change issue?
- If so, how?

## 29.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Classes, modelling, physics laboratory

**Description**: The teaching experience consisted of an after-school
laboratory course held in a science-oriented Italian secondary school.
The teaching materials designed and implemented in the course aimed to
foster (i) Deep understanding of the basic concepts involved in global
warming and climate change (disciplinary dimension), (ii) Critical
thinking about the Man-Nature-Society relationship in order to acquaint
students with past or current political and economic debates (societal
dimension), (iii)Appropriation of a refined epistemological discourse
where: i) controversies and scientific debates find legitimacy; and ii)
modelling in climate change is discussed and progressively framed within
the epistemological perspective of complexity (epistemological
dimension) 5 lab courses: 1. Introduction to climate change: scientific
research and new terms of the scientific controversy (general climate
science) 2. Experiments on examples of interaction between radiation and
matter (physics) 3. Experiments for the construction of a Greenhouse
Model (physics) 4. The epistemological perspective of complexity:
Introduction to the basic concepts for investigating complex systems
(mathematics and physics) 5. Political and Economic scenarios: overview
of climate treaties and proposals to cut emissions (political, economic
and sociological science)

## 29.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: During the implementation many different data were collected
to trace students’ development along each of the three dimensions
(disciplinary, societal, epistomological) ((studied more precisely in
other papers)). ((Here)) we focused on the five interviews collected at
the end of the teaching experience. The five students were chosen in
order to represent different attitudes toward the activities. Student 6
(S6) represents a “shy” person in the class, he actively took part in
the lab activities but he was not pro-active in the collective
discussions; student 13 (S13) represents the “excellent” student of the
class, he was much appreciated by the teacher and recognized by the
classmates as a leader; student 16 (S16) represents the “sceptic”
attitude toward climate change, he was not interested in the issue and
demonstrated mistrust toward the activities; student 25 (S25) represents
the “outsider” of the class, he was not particularly interested in the
activities in general and also in the climate change issue; finally,
student 26 (S26) represents the “thoughtful” attitude toward knowledge,
he was very heedful but silent throughout the whole process.

**Analysis**: ((More precise in previous papers)) a fine-grained
analysis allowed us to identify some markers to make visible if and how
students enriched and refined their epistemological knowledge (Tasquier
et al., 2015). The markers concern: i) the use of the vocabulary,
i.e. the number and quality of epistemological words used by the
students in writing and talking about physical phenomena and their
modelling; ii) the patterns of argumentation used by students in talking
about the Model-Experiment-Reality relationship. ((Specific to this
study)) Very descriptive analysis of the interviews. ((There is no clear
theoretical framework for the qualitative analysis, nor a very precise
description of the method)) 1. we took into account the temporal map of
the single student in order to identify for each of them a specific
pattern of interaction between the students and the interviewer; 2) we
identified the main message expressed by the student about his personal
experience in the course; 3) we identified words or expressions that
each student repeated several times during the interview to express and
articulate their main message.

**Results**: Results pre-post (epistomological levels, disciplinary
achievement, and behavioral level ((intent))): except student S6 (“the
Shy”) all 5 students accomplished a medium to high disciplinary
achievement, improved both their epistomological levels and behavioral
level ((intent))). (results of each of the 5 students are analysed very
precisely, but it would take too much space to report here) Results from
the interviews (results of each of the 5 students are analysed very
precisely, but it would take too much space to report here): 2 groups of
students: 1. S25 (“the outsider”) , S16 (“the sceptic”) and S26 (“the
thoughtful”), both S25, and S26 accomplished a medium achievement level,
corresponding to a good epistomological improvement, but a low
behavioral ((intent)) improvement. S16 accomplished a high achievement
level, coming from low levels on both epistomological level and behavior
((intent)) level but ended up to the best at the end of the instruction.
They were very at ease during the interviews and could express
themselves comfortably. From those 3 students: the epistemological
dimension and, in particular, the perspective of complexity was, in some
cases, productive intriggering a change in students’ attitude towards
climate change. Our three cases alone allow us to conclude that
significant. We correlations can be found between the epistemological
and behavioural dimensions and that the teaching path was able to
create, for some students, a virtuous dynamic state among them.
((These)) three cases concern students who had an initial distrust or
resistance toward climate change issues and found personal new reasons
for engagement in the epistemological perspective of complexity. 2. S13
(“the excellent”) and S6 (“the shy”). They were quite embarassed during
the interviews and did not enjoy so much, nor improved so much in
relation to the epistomological new way to present science.The other two
students acted as contrastive cases and allowed us to see some boundary
conditions needed to trigger personal involvement. These conditions
regard the need to master disciplinary knowledge in order to recognize
the value of the epistemological and social dimensions and the
importance of feeling free from the teacher’s expectations before being
able to explore and find one’s own position with respect to such complex
issues.

**Improved?**: There were an improvement in both behavioral ((intent))
and epistomological knowledge. Moreover for 3 of the 5 students, the
idea of epistomological complexity allowed us to lower skepticism, lack
of interest, and distrust toward the topic of climate change.

## 29.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Epistomological levels (e.g. understanding of
complexity in the physical models) of the answers in the prepost test
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - decrease in the boredom, disinterest and distrust
toward the topic of climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: - the “behavioral level” corresponds to the willingness
to take action and change one’s lifestyle in order to prevent climate
change, together with a detailed explanation consistent with the content
of the course (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 29.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: There were an improvement in both behavioral $$intent$$
and epistomological knowledge. Moreover for 3 of the 5 students, the
idea of epistomological complexity allowed us to lower skepticism, lack
of interest, and distrust toward the topic of climate change. “Specific
epistemological know-how can positively impact not only productive
disciplinary engagement, but also a more personal and authentic
involvement in climate change.”

**Message to keep:**: The main idea of this paper is very interesting:
showing how epistomological knowledge (en particular the idea of
complexity in the physical modelling of climate change) can foster
engagement $$awareness, intent$$ toward climate change mitigation. And
it seems to work on 3 of the 5 students analysed here! $$My own
reflection; Maybe changing the discourse toward this kind of knowledge
on the roots of methodological controversies in science is more
efficient than the real classical knowledge of climate change?$$ Note
that it is difficult to use this paper alone because it is part of a
series of papers describing different aspects of the same pedagogical
experience

**title** Promoting Climate-friendly Actions of High School Students: A
Case from Turkey

## 30.1 abstract

Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate a case in which various
extracurricular activities were implemented to promote high school
students’ climate-friendly actions. Research Methods: This study’s case
was the Green Team Student Club, in which 18 high school students
engaged voluntarily in different types of extracurricular activities
during student club hours throughout two school semesters. Data were
collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews, observations, and
document analysis of the student tasks. Findings: Findings revealed that
the students explicitly displayed climate-friendly behaviours such as
developing strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of their school,
becoming conscious energy and water consumers, and informing other
people about climate change while they developed action competence
through knowledge-construction (attending interactive seminars, field
visits, etc.), dissemination of knowledge (preparing posters, writing
articles for the school journal, etc.), and experiencing action
(calculating the carbon footprint of the school and developing
strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of the school, etc.).
Implications for Research and Practice: While the results may provide
insights for teachers and school principals about integrating
extracurricular activities within the schooling process, policymakers
can also use them in planning to create climate-friendly educational
settings. (C) 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved

competence regarding CC.”

**Questions**:

“What is the role of extracurricular activities in promoting high school
students’ climate-friendly actions?”

## 30.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Student club, with various activities

**Description**: Activities from the Green club: - knowledge: attending
interactive seminars, watching documentary videos, attending site
visits, critical observation of the local environment - communication:
poster preparation for school walls, article writing for public appeal -
action: carbon footprint calculation, developing an action plan to
reduce the carbone footprint of the school, adopting the action plan

## 30.5 Methods/Results

face-to-face pre, reflective, and final interviews. (notes: 8 open ended
questions, reflective interview are conducted after each club session) -
observation form from the researchers and teachers - analysis of student
works (articles, posters etc)

**Analysis**: Qualitative content analysis

**Results**: All the result are analysed quantitatively, therefore,
expliciting here would be too long, however: - Knowledge improved
through various activities where the students asked specific questions
to the intervenants - Awareness improved, particularly on local CC
issues concerning the school, and toward all the school community -
Students took action and lowered the carbon footprint of the school -
the transport habits of the school community, however the authors note
that this was a very small improvement in the case of transport habits
of the teachers

**Improved?**: Knowledge improved through various activities where the
students asked specific questions to the intervenants - Awareness
improved, particularly on local CC issues concerning the school, and
toward all the school community - Students took action and lowered the
carbon footprint of the school - the transport habits of the school
community, however the authors note that this was a very small
improvement in the case of transport habits of the teachers

## 30.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: - Understanding of carbon footprint - developping
knowledge by asking question to intervenants concerning the activities
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: consciousness about the school carbon footprint and local
CC issues: - about the students themselves - toward the school
community - toward the transport habit of the teachers and the students
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**action**: - communication (posters on school walls and articles) -
designing and adopting a plan to reduce carbon footprint of the school
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**habit**: - personal habits of students and teachers (transport) -
reducing carbon footprint of the school through various habits
(*Worked?*: Yes )

## 30.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: “$$The authors show the positive$$ role of
extracurricular activities in promoting high school students’
climate-friendly actions”. “After active involvement in extracurricular
activities, students were able to develop and adopt an action plan to
reduce their school’s carbon footprint.”

**Message to keep:**: The authors present here a real strategy to fill
the knowledge-action gap, with extracurricular activities in a student
club. What is particularly notable is that the activities of the
students allowed to design and adopt a carbon footprint reduction plan
for the school which had a measurable effect

**title** Children’s constructive climate change engagement: Empowering
awareness, agency, and action

## 31.1 abstract

This mixed-methods study examined how ten- to twelve-year-old children
experienced and made sense of their growing climate change awareness
through an after-school program that used participatory methods to
facilitate children?s informed climate change action. The fifteen-week
program combined hands-on educational activities with digital
photography and culminated in youth-led action projects focused on
individual (i.e. daily habits) and collaborative change (i.e. community
projects). After the program, children knew significantly more about the
scientific and social dimensions of climate change than before, and more
than the average U.S. teen or adult. Survey and focus group analyses
showed that, in addition to learning, children were inspired and
motivated by their growing climate change awareness. Children felt
empowered by their knowledge and eager to learn more and take action to
minimize harms. Towards theorizing children?s constructive climate
change engagement, the importance of informal learning environments for
children?s intergenerational and political influence is discussed.

## 31.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

Developing and evaluating methods that cultivate children’s constructive
engagement

**Questions**:

What were children’s perceptions of climate change before and after the
program? How did the program impact children’s climate change knowledge?
How did children experience their growing climate change awareness?

## 31.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: extracurricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: Both

**Type**: Hands-on activities, digital photography, community projects

**Description**: 15 week after school programme - Science (6 weeks): 1h
eductional hands-on activities compiled from climate change educational
resources online - Camera : photovoice (photo-printing and discussion)
process (once every month during 3 months, interlaced with science
activities) - individual action (weeks 8-13) Family action plans (carbon
footprint and planning sustainable habits in the household) -
collaborative youth led action (weeks 11-15) depending on the 3 sites:
city council presentation and tree planting, photovoice gallery
exposition and program website, or community garden

## 31.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: before and after the programme surveys 2 additional post
programme open ended questions 11 focus group with 4-5 children, 38min

**Analysis**: Quantitative: Dependent sample t-tests on questionnaire
Cohen’s d effect size - Qualitative: Transcription of focus groups and
open ended survey items were analysed according to thematic analysis
(Braun and Clarke 2006)

**Results**: Children perception ((AWARENESS)) of climated change: - 16
participants (29.6%) became more certain that climate change is
happening now, and 4 participants (7.4%) became less certain. However,
most participants (n 1⁄4 34; 63%) did not change their response over
time. - After the program, fewer than 1 in 5 children (18.2%) thought
about climate change ‘Not at all’ or ‘Not a lot,’ compared to 52.7% in
the presurvey. Of 55 participants, 31 (56.4%) reported thinking more
about climate change after the program than before, 11 (20%) less, and
13 (23.6%) the same amount. - Children’s certainty and time spent
thinking about climate change both showed statistically significant mean
increases following SCA Chidren climate change knowledge: - This
paired-samples t test showed a statistically significant mean increase
in children’s climate change knowledge following their program
participation - 68% of SCA children responded correctly to climate
change knowledge questions, compared to 56 and 59% of U.S. teens and
adults, respectively - quali: Compared to school, SCA was perceived to
cover the causes and consequences of climate change in greater depth.

**Improved?**: Awareness improved in aspects of certainty and thoughts
about climate change Knowledge improved

## 31.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Correctness of questions concerning CC in questionnaire
(*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Certainty, thought and beliefs about CC as an
environmental and social issue (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 31.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Children’s average climate change awareness $$contains
knowledge$$ post-program had expanded beyond their own pre-program
knowledge, beyond the average U.S. teen or adult, and in some cases
beyond the boundaries of program content.

**Message to keep:**: In this after-school programme in somewhat low
income communities, the combination of hands-on educational activities,
photovoice process, and youth-led action projects allowed to reach a
level of awareness and knowledge that goes beyond average in teenager
and adult from USA. 2 details that may be interesting for the
synthesis - action is a trigger for knowledge and awareness, it should
not necesarily to be a later step in the awareness to action process -
knowledge gains beyond the scope of the educational interventions

**title** “Sustainable City”: A Steam Project Using Robotics to Bring
the City of the Future to Primary Education Students

## 32.1 abstract

This article presents a STEAM project, “Sustainable City”, based on
educational robotics whose objective is to bring the problems of climate
change closer to primary school students. The participants were 30
students (aged 10–11) from 5th year of Primary Education and the project
consisted of 14 sessions in which different active methodologies such as
project-based learning, collaborative learning and the flipped classroom
were carried out. A pre-test and a post-test were carried out and the
results were better in the post-test, which indicates that the students
improved their skills and increased their motivation. As a conclusion,
this STEAM project, which is adapted to the Spanish LOMCE curriculum,
can be a reference for other teachers to bring their students closer to
the problem of environmental change through educational robotics and the
use of active methodologies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI,

## 32.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

To present ((ndlr: and to evaluate)) an inclusive, resilient and
sustainable model for the city of the future

**Questions**:

NA

## 32.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Robotic activity, lessons and debate

**Description**: Creating a sustainable city robotic board, with the
help of experts and teachers. Active methodologies are used in this
project, such as project-based learning, collaborative learning and the
flipped classroom (FC), in which the students become the protagonists of
the teaching-learning process and build their own knowledge.

## 32.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: pre-test/ post-test

**Analysis**: The result of pre- and post- test are noted, and compared
(no statistical test). Consistency of the survey results are tested with
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and Kurder-Richardson method. No
statistical analysis is done for neither awareness nor motivation, it is
only the author appreciation

**Results**: We can see that the overall performance doubled, from 2.9
in the pre-test to 6.1 in the post-test, with the efficiency concept
being the one that increased the most and those of renewable energies
and mobility the least.Table 3 shows the values obtained in both
studies, observing high or very high results in the concepts evaluated,
and very high results in the complete test in which a 0.96 was obtained
in both studies; these results sufficiently guarantee the reliability of
the test and its internal consistency.

**Improved?**: Better knowledge

## 32.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: improved student knowledge and concept, from a
“Competence questionnaire on sustainability” (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: Bring students closer to the problem of environmental
change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**other**: Motivation (*Worked?*: Yes )

## 32.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: This STEAM project can be used by other teachers as a
reference to bring their students closer to the problem of environmental
change through educational robotics and the use of active methodologies.

**Message to keep:**: What is particularly notable is the use of
robotics to teach Climate Change to very young students Also the steAm
(STEM + Art) framework is original, and the “sustainable city” idea as
well.

**title** “Thank You for Being Republican”: Negotiating Science and
Political Identities in Climate Change Learning

## 33.1 abstract

When engaging with socioscientific issues, learners act at the
intersection of scientific, school, and other societal communities,
drawing on knowledge, practices, and identities from both in and out of
the classroom to address problems as national or global citizens. We
present three case studies of high school students whose classroom
participation in a unit on the politically polarizing topic of climate
change was informed by their political identities and how they situated
themselves in climate change’s sociocultural, historical, and geologic
context. We describe how these students, including two who initially
rejected human-influenced climate change but revised their
understandings, negotiating dissonant identities in the classroom
through repeated engagement with conflicting political and scientific
values, knowledge, and beliefs. These case studies problematize building
bridges between formal and informal learning experiences and suggest
that it may be necessary to leverage disconnections in addition to
building connections across settings to promote productive identity
work. The results further suggest that supporting climate change
learning includes attending to identity construction across ecosocial
timescales, including geologic time.

## 33.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

In this study we examine how students’ identities as participants in
political and scientific communities informed their participation in a
unit on the ecological impacts of climate change.

**Questions**:

- What scientific and political knowledge, practices, and identities do
  the students leverage as they participate in the ecological impacts of
  climate change unit?
- In what ways do the scientific and political knowledge, practices, and
  identities conflict, and how do students resolve these differences
  over time?
- How do the ways in which learners situate themselves with respect to
  social and ecological process across timescales inform their
  perceptions and valuing of climate change science and responses?

## 33.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: curricular

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons, class discussions, data analysis activities, citizen
science participation, infographic communication

**Description**: “Ecological impacts of climate change curriculum”: 1,
introduction and context (1 week): introductive class discussion, media
exploration (youTube videos of scientists and politiicians), class
discussions about arguments and evidences, questions to scientists on
social media platform created for it 2. Evidence and Impacts (3 weeks):
going to local park 3 times to conduct field work related to
phenological shifts and contribute to the National Phenology Network, a
citizen science effort, research on a case study of climate impacts on a
local species using GIS and climate model data,experiment with Wisconsin
Fast Plant, analyses of time series data on atmospheric and oceanic data
with scientists, activity on ice core with scientist, calculation of
economic costs of affected ecosystem services 3. Infographic (2 weeks):
students used class data and their own research to construct an
infographic or visual display of data, feedback of the scientists,
revision and presentation

## 33.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: Data sources included the following: ● Video observations of
Mr. S’s classroom (~30 hr, October 17–December 6, 2011) ● Video-recorded
exit interviews with the students at the end of the unit (30– 60 min per
student, in groups of two or three) ● Curricular artifacts, including
pre- and posttests, student work, student posts on the social media
platform, responses by experts to student work, weekly engagement
surveys, and digital photographs ● Qualitative field notes of classroom
activities (~80 pages)

**Analysis**: (Qualitative) We analyze how learners enacted and
constructed identities through a framework of Discourses that relate to
societal Conversations (Gee, 2011).

**Results**: Results are difficult to synthetise (detailed analyses of
the 3 cases over 42 pages, with quite a different objective from ours),
however the main ideas are: - Luke (republican with a climate denier
father) had to negotiate the conflict between the curriculum’s
scientific content and the political beliefs of his family, but change
his views about climate change and integrate knowledge about it -
Timothy (republican) was also very critical about the reality of
anthropogenic climate change. His personal identity as someone who was
good at science helped support his engagement with the evidence. This
continuity of this valued practice across settings ultimately supported
Timothy in negotiating tensions between the communities to which he
belonged and his continuing science identity work. Timothy participated
a lot in the debate, integrated a lot of the scientific processes and
knowledge and changed radically its view toward anthropogenic climate
change - Gareth (democrats with eco-concerned parents) thought that he
did not need to be convinced because of its democrat background. He did
not participate very actively in discussions, and ended up more or less
sure of the mechanisms of climate change, his statements demonstrate
that his understanding of climate change was a dynamic one influenced
both by the science he learned as well as by the controversy that he was
exposed to through social interactions in the classroom. However, he
deepened his understanding of both the scientific and political
dimensions, and as a result he wanted to continue to learn more about
thescientific evidence and the social controversy While actions and
intents were not central in the analyses, the authors noted that the 3
students were not very eager in taking actions against climate change,
for various reasons

**Improved?**: All students accepted the scientific reality of
anthropogenic climate change, however with some doubts and difficulties
to integrate this reality with their own political identities or the
environment of political debate surrounding it in USA. All students
improved in terms of scientific knowledge and understanding of the CC
processes. None of the 3 students seems eager to take action.

## 33.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Knowledge about the scientific processes and the
associated evidencesconcerning CC (*Worked?*: Yes )

**awareness**: - Belief about anthropogenic climate change -
consciousness (and differenciation) of the political and scientific
aspects of climate change (*Worked?*: Yes )

**intention**: Willingness to take action or change habits (*Worked?*:
No )

## 33.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: While the class and activities had a positive impact on
the knowledge and awareness of the students concerning climate change,
it is important to consider the difficult negociation between political,
educative and social identities that CCE confront. To most effectively
support learning of climate change, research must better explicate these
interactions to support learners as they navigate communities and
negotiate identities.

**Message to keep:**: Very interesting and different article, the
authors show some encouraging results concerning gain of knowledge and
awareness, but what is really interesting is how this is accompanied by
very complicated negociations of identities in middle-class-USA, where
largely shared political positions are against the idea of anthropogenic
climate change. Moreover the authors mention that none of the studied
students is eager to take action, and it might be related to the
political climate of USA.

The establishment of the Next Generation Science Standards brought
climate science into standards-based education. However, teachers face
challenges implementing these standards, including a lack of resources
and textbooks, which may not accurately describe climate science or the
forces driving those changes. A climate science workshop was conducted
to give teachers an agriculturally based climate change curriculum.
Using agriculture as the context for teaching about climate change
provided teachers with opportunities to tie local, real-world climate
change examples to their students’ lives. Teachers attending the
workshop expressed similar opinions to the general population ranging
from climate change denial to alarm before receiving the training.
Teachers’ opinions relating to climate science changed following the
presentation of climate science presented as an integrated component of
modern agronomic production. Teachers appreciated receiving facts and
being allowed to decide for themselves about the severity of the
changing climate. Contrary to what teachers reported anticipating,
communities considered skeptical of climate change claims were accepting
of an agriculturally based curriculum presenting climate change and
adaptation as scientific facts void of political agendas. © 2022 The

## 34.3 Objective/questions

**Objective**:

The purpose of this case study was to describe changes in teacher
attitudes toward climate change and inclusion of climate science lessons
in their curriculum after attendance at a 3-day climate change
professional development workshop and teaching two units infused with
climate science principles focusing on soils and erosion presented as
part of the workshop.

**Questions**:

NA

## 34.4 Intervention

**Curricular/Extra**: Professional development

**Indoor/Outdoor**: indoor

**Type**: Lessons

**Description**: Teachers attended a workshop designed to provide
laboratory experiences relating to climate change, soils, erosion, and
ecological cycling.

## 34.5 Methods/Results

**Data**: semi-structured interviews and qualitative analyses

**Analysis**: Qualitative semi structured interviews, before the
workshop and after (by phone). Qualitative analyses of the teacher
discourses

**Results**: Gaps in the teacher knowledge base were filled and teachers
felt more confident/motivated/concerned to integrate CCE in their
curricular teachings. The inclusion of CCE was easier than expected

**Improved?**: Qualitative arguments that the attitudes of the teachers
change, their views were more in agreement with the science, they taught
more about CC, this did not pose particular problems. Note that the
authors insist on the relevance of teaching CC in agricultural science
in such rural regions

## 34.6 Outcomes

**knowledge**: Fill gaps in teacher’s knowledge base (*Worked?*: yes )

**awareness**: Change in professional attitudes toward more teaching of
climate change, and consciousness that it is a topic that may be taught
in their specialty, without the previously imagined dificulties.
(*Worked?*: yes )

## 34.7 Conclusions

**Conclusions**: Two factors emerged in this study: (a) agriculture was
a good context for delivering the complex science concepts of climate
change and (b) locally relevant climate science was accepted, even among
those considered skeptical of its legitimacy. These pose opportunities
for curriculum designers and teachers implementing the NGSS.
Additionally, the combination of agriculture and climate science
represents a good application of cross-cutting concepts and helps
eliminate silos of instruction.

**Message to keep:**: The authors analysed qualitatively the impact of a
workshop on teaching CC in agriculture science, also after the teachers
got back to classes and could apply their newly acquired knowledge
